Price to take immediate action and advocate on behalf of Juana Tobar, Rosa Ortez-Cruz, Samuel Oliver, Eliseo Jimenez, Oscar Canales, and Jose Chicas.<\/p>\n<p>Congressman Price is hosting a Town Hall meeting in Raleigh on Thursday, July 19th. This is a perfect opportunity to highlight the inhumane treatment of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hashtag\/ncsanctuary6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">#NCSanctuary6<\/a>\u00a0and their families.<\/p>\n<p>For these families waiting is no longer an option, they need action right now. Rep. Price has the power to bring attention to these cases, and we need to make sure he understands what is at stake.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to bring these stories to his front door.<\/p>\n<p>We will tell Congressman Price to do everything in his power for Juana, Rosa, Samuel, Oscar, Eliseo, and Jose &#8211; to secure their return to their families and homes safe from deportation.<\/p>\n<p>Combined, Juana, Rose, Samuel, Oscar, Eliseo, and Jose have spent over 50 months in church sanctuary. Over 1,500 days without intervention or assistance from elected Representatives, including Congressman David Price.<\/p>\n<p>Join us on July 19th. For Juana, waiting is no longer an option, she has now been in sanctuary for over a year. Join us at the town hall so we can bring her story, and that of the other NC Sanctuary 6, right to Price&#8217;s doorstep. Make sure you wear white to support the #NCSanctuary6!<\/p>\n<p>Join us!<\/p>\n<p>-Alerta Migratoria<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Falertamigratorianc.org%2F&amp;h=AT1EgTm6iG-_tJBfZ6YgQJstG9QEmvngJXp0_u6gk36vPIEEickLZ8opU41PqWaFVa-TuZbXB1Qm_M6GmgReFEHxTwoX8t2epUJa-hmf802JQUOSZk6F8sN9rVDUPzmJ&amp;s=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/alertamigratorianc.org\/<\/a><\/p>","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","slug":"july-19-rep-david-price-town-hall-meeting-step-up-for-immigrants-raleigh","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/36137211_1964660443544025_2824099502888058880_n.jpg","id":4270,"extension":"jpg","width":540,"height":960,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/36137211_1964660443544025_2824099502888058880_n-150x150.jpg"},"medium":{"width":169,"height":300,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/36137211_1964660443544025_2824099502888058880_n-169x300.jpg"},"home-bottom":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/36137211_1964660443544025_2824099502888058880_n-150x150.jpg"},"home-middle":{"width":332,"height":190,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/36137211_1964660443544025_2824099502888058880_n-332x190.jpg"},"home-top":{"width":540,"height":400,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/36137211_1964660443544025_2824099502888058880_n-540x400.jpg"},"slider":{"width":540,"height":400,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/36137211_1964660443544025_2824099502888058880_n-540x400.jpg"},"woocommerce_thumbnail":{"width":450,"height":450,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","uncropped":true,"url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/36137211_1964660443544025_2824099502888058880_n-450x450.jpg"},"woocommerce_gallery_thumbnail":{"width":100,"height":100,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/36137211_1964660443544025_2824099502888058880_n-100x100.jpg"},"shop_catalog":{"width":450,"height":450,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/36137211_1964660443544025_2824099502888058880_n-450x450.jpg"},"shop_thumbnail":{"width":100,"height":100,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/36137211_1964660443544025_2824099502888058880_n-100x100.jpg"}}},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2018-07-16 18:30:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"07","day":"16","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2018-07-16 20:30:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"07","day":"16","hour":"20","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2018-07-16 22:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"07","day":"16","hour":"22","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2018-07-17 00:30:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"07","day":"17","hour":"00","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_abbr":"EDT","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1976239549053807\/","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":4271,"author":"22","status":"publish","date":"2018-07-16 09:22:47","date_utc":"2018-07-16 13:22:47","modified":"2018-07-16 09:22:47","modified_utc":"2018-07-16 13:22:47","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/venue\/723-st-marys-st\/","venue":"723 St. Mary&#8217;s St.","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","slug":"723-st-marys-st","address":"723 St. Mary's St.","city":"Raleigh","country":"United States","state":"NC","zip":"27605","stateprovince":"NC","geo_lat":35.7892144,"geo_lng":-78.6514713,"json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"723 St. Mary&#8217;s St.","description":"","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/venue\/723-st-marys-st\/","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"723 St. Mary&#039;s St.","addressLocality":"Raleigh","addressRegion":"NC","postalCode":"27605","addressCountry":"United States"},"geo":{"@type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":35.7892144,"longitude":-78.6514713},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.unitingnc.org?id=4271","global_id_lineage":["www.unitingnc.org?id=4271"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"July 19:  Rep.
