Award-winning artist JR and TIME Magazine have created a video mural with interviews from people with wide ranging opinions and experiences with guns, gun violence, and second amendment rights. JR\u2019s video mural will be on view and serve as the starting point for the discussion, moderated by Jennifer Copeland, Executive Director of the North Carolina Council of Churches. The audio and videos in JR\u2019s mural represent a diverse spectrum of voices and stories within an often volatile and complex issue. This is not a discussion about policy or politics, but an opportunity to listen and share personal experiences and feelings about guns in America, in a safe, honest, and open environment.<\/p>\n<p>&gt; Learn more at <a href=\"https:\/\/21cdurham.com\/events?fbclid=IwAR365rQZn1tL7mKf3QmnxWc4N5hB3mbR5DWx3z90us8TaYU5k7zK5RN0YmY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"
