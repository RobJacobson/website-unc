They selected the Refugee Support Center, a volunteer-based organization in Carrboro that provides assistance and resources, as the recipient of the offering that will be received at the concert. They chose as the theme song, \u201cDraw the Circle Wide\u201d by Mark A. Miller, because it expresses the idea of drawing the circle of inclusion wide enough to encompass everyone in our community, regardless of their background.<\/p>\n<p>Youth Choirs from Binkley Baptist (Daniel Cherrix, Director), Christ United Methodist (Daniel Steinert, Director), Holy Trinity Lutheran (Laura Alexander, Cantor), University Presbyterian (Tim Baker, Director), University United Methodist (Beth Auman Visser, Director), and United Church of Chapel Hill (Jennifer Anderson, Director) will perform together and separately. As special guests, the Karen Choir (Paw Yeh, Coordinator), a choir made up of refugees from Burma, will also perform. A wide range of music styles will be represented, including traditional Karen and African, Gospel, contemporary and classical.<\/p>\n<p>The public is welcome to this concert, and admission is free.<\/p>","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","slug":"may-7th-youth-choirs-combine-support-community-refugees-chapel-hill","image":false,"all_day":false,"start_date":"2017-05-07 19:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"05","day":"07","hour":"19","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2017-05-07 21:00:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"05","day":"07","hour":"21","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2017-05-07 23:00:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"05","day":"07","hour":"23","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2017-05-08 01:00:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"05","day":"08","hour":"01","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_abbr":"EDT","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":2968,"author":"3","status":"publish","date":"2017-04-27 10:55:59","date_utc":"2017-04-27 14:55:59","modified":"2017-04-27 10:55:59","modified_utc":"2017-04-27 14:55:59","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/venue\/united-church-of-chapel-hill\/","venue":"United Church of Chapel Hill","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","slug":"united-church-of-chapel-hill","address":"1321 Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Chapel Hill","country":"United States","state":"NC","zip":"27514","stateprovince":"NC","geo_lat":35.9524257,"geo_lng":-79.05943,"json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"United Church of Chapel Hill","description":"","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/venue\/united-church-of-chapel-hill\/","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"1321 Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","addressLocality":"Chapel Hill","addressRegion":"NC","postalCode":"27514","addressCountry":"United States"},"geo":{"@type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":35.9524257,"longitude":-79.05943},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.unitingnc.org?id=2968","global_id_lineage":["www.unitingnc.org?id=2968"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"May 7th: Youth Choirs Combine to Support Community Refugees (Chapel Hill)","description":"&lt;p&gt;The Youth Choirs of six Chapel Hill churches will combine to create a massed choir of over 100 young voices to present a concert entitled \u201cDraw the Circle Wide.\u201d The concert will be held on\u00a0May 7 at 7 p.m.\u00a0at United Church of Chapel Hill.
