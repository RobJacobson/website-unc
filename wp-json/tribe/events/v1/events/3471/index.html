Through the Interfaith Immigration Coalition, the Shabbat for Immigrant Justice initiative is enlisting churches, synagogues and mosques across the U.S. to dedicate time during or around their regular weekly worship service to a conversation about the Dream Act and Immigrant Justice. As part of this partnership of faith-based organizations, Judea Reform is committed to supporting reforms to immigration policy that are fair and humane and reflect our mandate to welcome the stranger and treat all human beings with dign<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">ity and respect.<\/p>\n<p>Come join Judea Reform Congregation for a Shabbat Service for Immigrant Justice on Friday, November 3 at 7:30pm.<\/p>\n<p>Come by our Selfie Photo Booth at the Oneg &#8212; we will be taking photos to share on social media to amplify the\u00a0<a class=\"_58cn\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hashtag\/faith4dream\" data-ft=\"{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;*N&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:104}\">#Faith4Dream<\/a>\u00a0message.

This is the only home they have ever known. As their friends, allies, and faith leaders, it is our responsibility to do what we can to lift their voices and advocate for their safety. This is even more imperative now that President Trump has rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that kept almost 800,000 immigrant youth protected from deportation. Congress has less than six months to act and ensure these individuals are not betrayed by the U.S. government and deported. It is critical that Congress pass a \u201cclean\u201d Dream Act 2017, without enforcement provisions or other negative proposals.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/p>","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","slug":"november-3-shabbat-services-dreamers-immigrant-justice-durham","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/22851943_10159664218930790_7055643359775592013_n.jpg","id":3472,"extension":"jpg","width":620,"height":310,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/22851943_10159664218930790_7055643359775592013_n-150x150.jpg"},"medium":{"width":300,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/22851943_10159664218930790_7055643359775592013_n-300x150.jpg"},"home-bottom":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/22851943_10159664218930790_7055643359775592013_n-150x150.jpg"},"home-middle":{"width":332,"height":190,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/22851943_10159664218930790_7055643359775592013_n-332x190.jpg"},"shop_thumbnail":{"width":180,"height":180,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/22851943_10159664218930790_7055643359775592013_n-180x180.jpg"},"shop_catalog":{"width":450,"height":310,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/22851943_10159664218930790_7055643359775592013_n-450x310.jpg"}}},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2017-11-03 19:30:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"11","day":"03","hour":"19","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2017-11-03 21:30:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"11","day":"03","hour":"21","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2017-11-03 23:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"11","day":"03","hour":"23","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2017-11-04 01:30:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"11","day":"04","hour":"01","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_abbr":"EDT","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":3473,"author":"22","status":"publish","date":"2017-10-30 13:09:28","date_utc":"2017-10-30 17:09:28","modified":"2018-02-28 09:41:24","modified_utc":"2018-02-28 14:41:24","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/venue\/judea-reform\/","venue":"Judea Reform (in the Levin Social Hall)","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","slug":"judea-reform","address":"1933 Cornwallis Rd","city":"Durham","country":"United States","state":"NC","zip":"27705","stateprovince":"NC","geo_lat":35.9780539,"geo_lng":-78.9546604,"json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Judea Reform (in the Levin Social Hall)","description":"","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/venue\/judea-reform\/","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"1933 Cornwallis Rd","addressLocality":"Durham","addressRegion":"NC","postalCode":"27705","addressCountry":"United States"},"geo":{"@type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":35.9780539,"longitude":-78.9546604},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.unitingnc.org?id=3473","global_id_lineage":["www.unitingnc.org?id=3473"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"November 3: Shabbat Services for Dreamers &#038; Immigrant Justice (Durham)","description":"&lt;p&gt;Judea Reform is joining forces with the Union for Reform Judaism\u2019s Religious Action Coalition to support the Dream Sabbath initiative.
