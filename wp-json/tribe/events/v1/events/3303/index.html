We have to start mobilizing ourselves in an effective manner in order to get Congress on this. We cannot let the Trump administration use Congress as a scapegoat for destroying so many people&#8217;s lives.<\/p>\n<p>Join a panel of lawyers, activists, and students for a discussion about what happens now, how to protect our students, and how to support our undocumented and DACAmented community.
