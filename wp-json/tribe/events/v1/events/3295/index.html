Our families, friends, neighbors and co-workers are terrified about being detained and deported; profiled because of their religion, race or political beliefs; losing their health coverage; and facing hate and discrimination. Learn why congregations across the region and country are choosing to support and provide sanctuary, what it means in practice, and how to be successful at \u201cSanctuary Matters: Testimony and Best Practices.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Saturday, September 16 from 9 a.m.-12:30 p.m. the Unit<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">ed Church of Chapel will host an in-person, half-day training for congregations and clergy leaders interested in providing support and sanctuary for vulnerable individuals in North Carolina. We will discuss the many ways that your congregation can stand up against hate and dehumanization at this moment. Topics will include testimony from people who have been in sanctuary and congregations that have opened their doors as sanctuaries as well as training for congregations that are in the discernment process. The keynote speaker is Rev. Noel Andersen, Grassroots Organizer for Church World Service out of the Washington DC office. Time will be provided for congregations to network by geographic or faith affinity and a Peruvian lunch will also be provided. The cost is $10 and scholarships are available.<\/span><\/p>","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","slug":"september-16-sanctuary-matters-chapel-hill","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/20246513_1440928485955254_8022661190225491758_n.jpg","id":3296,"extension":"jpg","width":756,"height":960,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/20246513_1440928485955254_8022661190225491758_n-150x150.jpg"},"medium":{"width":236,"height":300,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/20246513_1440928485955254_8022661190225491758_n-236x300.jpg"},"home-bottom":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/20246513_1440928485955254_8022661190225491758_n-150x150.jpg"},"home-middle":{"width":332,"height":190,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/20246513_1440928485955254_8022661190225491758_n-332x190.jpg"},"home-top":{"width":700,"height":400,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/20246513_1440928485955254_8022661190225491758_n-700x400.jpg"},"shop_thumbnail":{"width":180,"height":180,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/20246513_1440928485955254_8022661190225491758_n-180x180.jpg"},"shop_catalog":{"width":450,"height":450,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/20246513_1440928485955254_8022661190225491758_n-450x450.jpg"},"shop_single":{"width":725,"height":725,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/20246513_1440928485955254_8022661190225491758_n-725x725.jpg"},"slider":{"width":756,"height":400,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/20246513_1440928485955254_8022661190225491758_n-756x400.jpg"}}},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2017-09-16 09:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"09","day":"16","hour":"09","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2017-09-16 12:30:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"09","day":"16","hour":"12","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2017-09-16 13:00:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"09","day":"16","hour":"13","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2017-09-16 16:30:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"09","day":"16","hour":"16","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_abbr":"EDT","cost":"$10","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"$","currency_position":"prefix","values":["10"]},"website":"","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":3313,"author":"22","status":"publish","date":"2017-09-06 12:48:01","date_utc":"2017-09-06 16:48:01","modified":"2017-09-06 12:48:01","modified_utc":"2017-09-06 16:48:01","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/venue\/united-church-of-chapel-hill-3\/","venue":"United Church of Chapel Hill","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","slug":"united-church-of-chapel-hill-3","address":"1321 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.","city":"Chapel Hill","country":"United States","state":"NC","zip":"27514","website":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1578078952234597\/","stateprovince":"NC","geo_lat":35.9524257,"geo_lng":-79.05943,"json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"United Church of Chapel Hill","description":"","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/venue\/united-church-of-chapel-hill-3\/","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"1321 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.","addressLocality":"Chapel Hill","addressRegion":"NC","postalCode":"27514","addressCountry":"United States"},"geo":{"@type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":35.9524257,"longitude":-79.05943},"telephone":"","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1578078952234597\/"},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.unitingnc.org?id=3313","global_id_lineage":["www.unitingnc.org?id=3313"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"September 16: Sanctuary Matters (Chapel Hill)","description":"&lt;p&gt;In light of recent events involving the deportation and fears of our immigrant brothers and sisters throughout the state, the NC Council of Churches\u2019 annual Faith &amp; Immigration Summit will focus on the topic of sanctuary this year.
