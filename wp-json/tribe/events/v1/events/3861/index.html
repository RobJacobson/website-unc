The event was originally titled \u201cThe American Muslim Identity: Patriot or Insurgent?\u201d as if those are the only two camps into which Muslims in the United States can fall. The Alexander Hamilton Society\u2019s choice to rehash and weaponize \u201cwith us or against us\u201d rhetoric against Muslims is disappointing and disrespectful both of Duke\u2019s Muslim students and Muslims writ large.<\/p>","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read
