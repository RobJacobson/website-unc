Though a step in the right direction and a signal that even the courts believe it is right to protect undocumented youth, Dreamers deserve more. They deserve a bipartisan clean Dream Act and they deserve it now.<span class=\"text_exposed_show\"><\/p>\n<p>Congress has until January 19th to pass the Dream Act. Despite rumors of progress in bipartisan negotiations, we have not yet seen a draft of the proposed legislation or a vote. North Carolinian Representatives and Senators need to hear from you, their constituents, before the 19th. Help us tell them why providing protection and stability to the over 800,000 youth at risk of losing status is important to you and to North Carolina.<\/p>\n<p>Can\u2019t make calls to supporters?
