We wholeheartedly believe that no human is illegal and that we must stand up for immigrant rights, which are human rights.<\/p>\n<p>Trump and his administration have been systematically criminalizing immigration and immigrants, from revoking Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) to ramping up intimidating ICE tactics.<\/p>\n<p>FAMILIES BELONG TOGETHER.<\/p>\n<p>End Family Separation.<br
