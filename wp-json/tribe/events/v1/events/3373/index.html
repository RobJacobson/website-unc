Now more than ever, local rural communities can come together in Orange county and discuss how we can create sanctuaries for everyone, and ensure safety in our schools, public spaces, and our homes.<\/p>\n<p>Together we will talk about our shared and personal histories, eat a meal and while working to create a shared future vision of what we want our communities to look like through art, music, movement, and activism.<\/p>\n<p>We know that NC has some of the most active KKK\/white supremacist<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">organizations in the country. We also know that NC has historically been the bedrock of multi-issue organizing and coalition building that brings those of us together that are committed to social, economic and environmental justice. This event is an opportunity to come together, build power and create sanctuaries for everyone. Our power lies in our ability to come together. WE ARE BETTER TOGETHER!!<\/p>\n<p>Our hopes for the day are to:<br \/>\n-Connect local organizations, families and individuals living in rural Orange county to one another; learn what is happening in your communities and how you can get involved<br \/>\n-Share our stories, resources and ideas<br \/>\n-Create a vision around what creating sanctuaries in our communities can look like and how can we get there together<br \/>\n-Food and Fellowship<br \/>\n-Engage in Art as Activism<br \/>\n-Have Fun Resisting Hate in Our State!<\/p>\n<p>This event is free and family friendly! There will be locally catered food, childcare &amp; children&#8217;s activities, and Spanish &amp; ASL interpretation available. For more information, contact Sol Pederson at spederson@lgbtqcenterofdur<wbr \/>ham.org or (919) 335-8736.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you again for all the work you are doing to make your communities sanctuaries
