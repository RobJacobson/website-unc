All our holy texts instruct us to welcome strangers in our midst and to show hospitality to foreigners. However, recent policies that have been deemed \u201cBiblical\u201d demonstrate overt racism, ignorance of the importance of family unity, and hostility towards those who are fleeing violence in their home countries. Our churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples believe deeply in the sanctity of the family and stand against prolonged family separation. The family unit is the foundation of society and families hold our country together. Refugee and immigrant leaders will speak about how they have been affected by this administration\u2019s policies. We must lift up a prophetic voice and stand against these egregious acts of the Trump Administration towards immigrants, refugees, and families.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","slug":"june-20-faith-leaders-decry-family-separation-on-world-refugee-day-raleigh","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/WRD-2018v2-1-pdf.jpg","id":4126,"extension":"pdf"},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2018-06-20 12:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"20","hour":"12","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2018-06-20 13:00:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"20","hour":"13","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2018-06-20 16:00:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"20","hour":"16","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2018-06-20 17:00:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"20","hour":"17","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_abbr":"EDT","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":4127,"author":"22","status":"publish","date":"2018-06-18 10:04:32","date_utc":"2018-06-18 14:04:32","modified":"2018-06-18 10:04:32","modified_utc":"2018-06-18 14:04:32","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/venue\/open-table-united-methodist-church\/","venue":"Open Table United Methodist Church","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","slug":"open-table-united-methodist-church","address":"824 N.
