We had so many great conversations about ways to make North Carolina a more welcoming place for immigrants. We also had great fun watching people fill up our world map with pins. We asked people to mark where they or their families had immigrated from, and hundreds of people marked their spot on the map. The finished product shows that we truly are a nation, and a state, of immigrants.<\/p>\n<p>We also unveiled a new Uniting NC T-shirt at the festival. It is modeled in the photo above by Uniting NC board member Dan Rearick. You can order your own, in a variety of colors and styles. If you&#8217;re interested, please contact Dan at dan@unitingnc.org by Friday. He&#8217;ll send you all the information you need to get your shirt.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, in addition to the International Festival, we had another great event this past weekend. Uniting NC arranged for two members of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nc-dreamteam.org\/\">North Carolina Dream Team<\/a> to speak at Raleigh&#8217;s Beth Meyer Synagogue. The two speakers told their stories of being brought, unwillingly, to the United States as children. They are now young adults who feel like Americans, but who have no legal status here. They are struggling to put themselves through college at out-of-state rates, without loans or financial aid, and their future prospects are severely limited. Their heart-felt speeches were truly moving, and we would love for more people to hear their stories. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/contact-us\/\">Let us know<\/a> if we can help bring these brave young people to speak at your gathering.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sorry for the silence on this blog, but Uniting NC has been extremely busy.
