It was humbling knowing that I could list a dozen more deserving people in the time it took to take that call from the White House. But it was also a great recognition of all the work Uniting NC has done, and of all our volunteers and supporters who recognize that when we treat new Americans the way we want to be treated, we are all better off.<\/p>\n<p>At the Champions of Change event, I shared the inspiring stories of a few recent immigrants to North Carolina, and how their contributions are making our state an even better home for all of us. Of course, there is so much more we could do to actively work with new Americans to help them help all of us build more successful communities. I appreciated the opportunity to describe how Uniting NC is accomplishing that.<\/p>\n<p>We had our light-hearted moments too, including a little fun at the expense of my new friend Flavia Jimenez of the U.S. Department of Education. To wrap up the event, she asked for a two-minute answer to a five-part question about how we can transform all sectors of society &#8211; business, education, etc. &#8211; so that new immigrants reach their full potential and America continues to be a global leader. I did my best.
