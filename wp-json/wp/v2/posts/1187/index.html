He wanted to e-mail me a link to the Australian Prime Minister\u2019s rant that immigrants should either speak English, or go back to their country. This e-mail has been floating around the internet for years, and is well established as a hoax. But the fact that it has become so widely known shows that many people agree with what it says.<\/p>\n<p>Virtually every year, bills are proposed that would establish English as the official language and take away interpretation services for immigrants. And a frequent complaint used to demonize immigrants is that they \u201cdon\u2019t want to learn English.\u201d Even I, someone who appreciates other cultures and languages, sometimes find myself frustrated by people who cannot communicate with me in English. My Italian grandparents learned English, I think, so why can\u2019t they?<\/p>\n<p>I think we can all agree that immigrants to the United States should learn English. But when we see people as human beings, rather than as parts of a faceless group, we can see that such blanket statements are not nearly as simple as they seem. Learning a language is a difficult and slow process \u2014 and even more so for people at the bottom of the economic ladder.<\/p>\n<p>I used to work with refugees, and many of them are working so hard to make ends meet and care for their families that they simply don\u2019t have time to attend English classes. Some want to take classes but can\u2019t find a spot or can\u2019t afford them. Others are illiterate in their native languages, making it extremely difficult to learn a second language. Some immigrants, if they do not have legal status, are afraid they will be deported if they sign up for classes. Yet, despite it all, today\u2019s immigrants are learning English as fast, or faster, than the many waves of immigrants who came before them.<\/p>\n<p>Immigrants understand how important English is. Many are reminded every day, when they can\u2019t communicate with someone in a store or at their child\u2019s school, when they can\u2019t get a better-paying job. When we can\u2019t talk to people, it\u2019s easy to stereotype and nurture resentments. But what if we instead tried to put ourselves in their shoes? We have built an economy that relies on immigrant labor. Now, how can build a state that allows them to assimilate and succeed?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A new guest post from Uniting NC volunteer Melissa Bellitto: Last night I had a discussion with an acquaintance about immigrants speaking English.
