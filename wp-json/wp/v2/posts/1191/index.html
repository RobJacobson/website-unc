Read on:<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A few weeks ago the youth group at my church was working together to dig up a new plot in our church garden. Varying degrees of delight and disgust erupted every time someone found a worm. As we raked and hoed, several of the youth who are ethnic Montagnard refugees from the mountains of Vietnam began telling stories, including one \u2013 which horrified their American peers \u2013 about walking to school barefoot on foggy days, when long, fat nightcrawlers covered the roads. The Montagnard youth described how they couldn\u2019t avoid stepping on the worms, and the feeling of worm guts squishing under their feet.<\/p>\n<p>I often pause in amazement at the vastly different childhoods these refugees have experienced when compared to the American-born youth at St. Paul\u2019s Christian Church. Even more amazing is how quickly these young Montagnards have adapted to American life, especially going to school in a new language and new culture. While they still struggle to master the intricacies of English grammar and vocabulary, some have joined the choir or wrestling team, made the honor roll and won citizenship awards, learned to drive, and use email and Facebook with ease. It\u2019s hard to imagine that five years ago, they lived in homes with no electricity and faced frequent harassment. Yet, it is easy to imagine that five years from now they will be doing great things for their families and for the community, given the right opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Many Montagnard refugees have made North Carolina their home after fleeing persecution in their native Vietnam. In 2002, St. Paul\u2019s Christian Church sponsored four Montagnard men, whose families soon followed. The oldest of their children are preparing to finish high school and look to the future. These families also have relatives back in Vietnam who would like to become teachers or nurses in order to improve life in their village. There\u2019s little extra money for college or vocational training, since their parents are working hard just to make ends meet. Through a new non-profit, the Montagnard Education Fund, young people in both the U.S. and Vietnam can follow their dreams of continuing their education.<\/p>\n<p>The inaugural fund raiser will be the<strong> All-Organic Fashion Show, Dinner and Sale on Saturday, April 16 at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stpauls.net\">St. Paul\u2019s Christian Church<\/a>, 3331 Blue Ridge Rd., Raleigh<\/strong>. The evening starts at 6 p.m. with a real Montagnard dinner, prepared like a traditional wedding feast over an open fire.\u00a0From 7-7:3 p.m. guests can shop in an open-air market for Fiberactive Organic\u2019s environmentally-friendly products, most of which are made at least partially by Montagnard women, as well as traditional handicrafts like weaving and bamboo items. The fashion show begins at 7:30 p.m., featuring 100% organic cotton clothing and re-purposed, re-claimed or recycled accessories, all made in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiberactiveorganics.com\">Fiberactive Organics<\/a>\u2019 Raleigh studio. Call Julie at 612-3765 for tickets and information, or purchase tickets at the door. Tickets for the dinner are $15, and the fashion show is $10 ($5 for students).<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll be there, because I believe our community can only grow and flourish, like a well-tended garden, if everyone is given the chance to develop their talents and knowledge. North Carolina is stronger and healthier because of the presence of people with so many different experiences and perspectives. The Montagnard refugees at St. Paul\u2019s Christian Church have taught us so much through sharing their stories, and we want to support their desire to keep learning.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Read this post from Diane Faires, a Uniting NC volunteer and a pastor at St. Paul&#8217;s Christian Church, to learn about a great event that you can attend on Saturday evening.
