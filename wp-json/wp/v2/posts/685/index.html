In what appears to have been an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/01\/11\/us\/11giffords.html?hp\">assassination attempt<\/a>, Congresswoman <a href=\"https:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/people\/g\/gabrielle_giffords\/index.html\">Gabrielle Giffords<\/a> was shot point blank in the head during a political appearance outside a grocery store. She was one of 14 people wounded and six killed in the shooting spree. A judge and a 9-year-old girl are among the dead. When politically motivated massacres start happening in suburban shopping centers, we must ask ourselves: Has something gone wrong in our country?<\/p>\n<p>After years of watching partisan anger boil over and spill out all over the United States, this crime <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2011\/01\/09\/AR2011010903893.html\">feels to many of us<\/a> like the obvious outcome of so much rancor and dehumanizing rhetoric. In the debate over our country&#8217;s future, we have sometimes stopped seeing each other as fellow Americans. Instead, we regularly describe people with different political beliefs as &#8220;scary&#8221; or &#8220;evil.&#8221; We have come to think of our political opponents more as enemies than as people. As we have seen throughout history, terrible crimes can ensue when we stop seeing any group of people as human beings.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, the accused shooter appears to have been mentally  disturbed, and his motives are not yet known. We don&#8217;t know whether the  fiery immigration debate in Arizona influenced his actions or not. But it does seem plausible that he was emboldened by political and  anti-government beliefs \u2014 a revelation that should be a call to action for all of us.<\/p>\n<p>There is nothing more fundamental to the American experiment than the belief that every person is deserving of respect and justice.\u00a0 All of Uniting NC&#8217;s work is based on this belief. That is why we work not on divisive political policy issues, but on helping people come together to talk, and to see that underneath our differences, we are all people who want and need the same things. During the past year, at Uniting NC film screenings, community meals and discussions across the state, we have watched people of varied beliefs and backgrounds come together for peaceful, reasoned conversation. We have seen people start to understand one another a little better.<\/p>\n<p>The events in Arizona show us why we must work harder. We must all renew our commitment to creating civil discourse \u2014 even on the most difficult topics \u2014 that honors  the humanity of every person.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This weekend, the unthinkable happened in Arizona.
