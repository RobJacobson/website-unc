A year ago, I had never spoken more than a  few words to a Muslim person. And my thoughts about my Muslim neighbors  consisted mostly of, \u201cWow, that head scarf must be hot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even  yesterday, before I walked into that house, I had heard of Ramadan, but  had no idea what it meant. Thirty days of fasting from dawn to sunset,  not even taking a sip of water in the heat of August. Thirty days of  praying late into the night and rising to eat before the sun comes up.  Thirty unrelenting days of hunger and fatigue, while the routines and  obligations of regular life go on.<\/p>\n<p>And  yet, during those 30 days, Muslims are called upon to be their best  selves \u2014 to be kind and pious, to be generous and compassionate, to  invite family and friends into their homes.<\/p>\n<p>I  have spent a lifetime feeling sorry for people who deny themselves the  freedom to eat or wear or do whatever they want. Yet, it took only two  hours in that house for me to see the error of my thinking.<\/p>\n<p>For the first time, I saw the power in those sacrifices.<\/p>\n<p>While  I spend my days addicted to my own comfort, trying constantly to  satisfy my cravings, becoming irritated at small inconveniences, Ramadan  has taught my Muslim friends to accept that life isn\u2019t always  comfortable. It has taught them to live up to their ideals even when  things are hard.<\/p>\n<p>While  I am so often sequestered in my privileged world, wishing for more than  I already have, their hunger and thirst reminds them to be grateful for  what they do have and compassionate for those who go without all year  round. During Ramadan, a glass of water becomes a miracle.<\/p>\n<p>But  most of all, what I learned from sitting in that living room was how  much we all have in common \u2014 no matter how differently we dress or pray.  Many of the women I ate with had been born and raised in this country,  blowing up my perception that Ramadan and Islam were merely foreign  traditions.<\/p>\n<p>And  whether we are immigrants or natives, Muslims, Jews, Christians or  athiests, we all love to be surrounded by our families and friends, to  smile and laugh, to enjoy good food. We all wake up every day and try to  figure out how to do our best, despite our failings and cravings.<\/p>\n<p>I  left wishing I could figure out how to give every person in North  Carolina the opportunity to sit in the living room of someone they  consider \u201cforeign\u201d and understand for themselves how difference  dissolves when we truly see each other.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last night, I found myself sitting in a living room on the last evening of Ramadan, the only non-Muslim in house full of nearly two dozen people.
