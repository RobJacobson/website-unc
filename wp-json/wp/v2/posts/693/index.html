We had a very successful volunteer training session in mid-January, where 20 people learned about Uniting NC and how they can help spread our message of respect and inclusiveness to their own communities. We are amazed at the amount of energy and good ideas these new volunteers are already bringing to Uniting NC. If we keep building this network of motivated volunteers, we really can change North Carolina for the better. We&#8217;re planning to hold more of these sessions this year, so please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/contact-us\/\">let us know<\/a> if you are interested in coming to one.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most exciting results of the session was finding a volunteer who is willing to act as Uniting NC&#8217;s volunteer coordinator. Kim Swanson, of Chapel Hill, will lead and support volunteers as they plan events and help Uniting NC in myriad other ways. She also wants to make volunteering for Uniting NC fun. I know we&#8217;re all going to love working with her. Here is a message from Kim:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m excited to work with Uniting NC because I believe in the power of  community.\u00a0 Change and understanding come from individuals opening their  hearts to diversity, and Uniting NC gives  people the opportunity to meet and understand life experiences of people  different from themselves.\u00a0 My grandparents were immigrants from Cuba, and I have always respected and admired people  brave enough to start a life away from home. I am especially impressed  with the resiliency and strength of immigrants in North Carolina, a  state where many are still adjusting to an incredible increase in diversity.<\/p>\n<p>As the volunteer coordinator, I hope to create a community where  volunteers know each other and feel supported and needed. I&#8217;ve had the  opportunity to coordinate volunteers at Wingate University&#8217;s volunteer  organization for three years and through Church World Service and the  Union County and Mecklenburg County CROP Hunger Walks. Last year I was  the volunteer coordinator at Posada Esperanza Shelter for Immigrant  Women and Children. I hope that these experiences and my current role as  a student at the UNC School of Social Work will give us an exciting and  successful year. I look forward to serving with you!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_694\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-694\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/Kim1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-694\" title=\"Kim Swanson\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/Kim-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-694\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kim and her husband<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Uniting NC is off to a great start in 2011.
