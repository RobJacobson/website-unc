But they\u2019re making the same offer to organizations in 13 states, and they don\u2019t have enough funds for all the organizations. So please consider contributing this week, so that we can be sure to double the impact of your contribution.<\/p>\n<p>For accounting reasons, Welcoming America can only match donations of at least $200. But even if you can\u2019t make a large enough contribution for matching, please consider making a smaller donation. Every dollar really does count for a small non-profit like Uniting NC.<\/p>\n<p>What could these contributions mean for North Carolina? It could mean a dozen more events in 2011 in which we bring together recent immigrants and long-term residents to learn from one another. It could mean getting our message out to thousands more North Carolinians via billboards, the radio and maybe even television. It would mean concrete steps toward building the type of communities in which we can all proudly call North Carolina home.<\/p>\n<p>We thank you so much for the faith and confidence you place in Uniting NC.
