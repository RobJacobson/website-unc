Chobani is now widely considered to be worth several billion dollars.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"303\" data-total-count=\"902\">\u201cI\u2019ve built something I never thought would be such a success, but I cannot think of Chobani being built without all these people,\u201d Mr. Ulukaya said in an interview in his Manhattan office that was granted on the condition that no details of the program would be disclosed before the announcement.<\/p>\n<p id=\"story-continues-1\" class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"114\" data-total-count=\"1016\">\u201cNow they\u2019ll be working to build the company even more and building their future at the same time,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Chobani employees received the news on Tuesday morning. Each worker received a white packet; inside was information about how many Chobani shares they were given. The number of shares given to each person is based on tenure, so the longer an employee has been at the company, the bigger the stake.<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"story-body-supplemental\">\n<div class=\"story-body story-body-2\">\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"333\" data-total-count=\"1646\">Two years ago, when Chobani\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2014\/04\/23\/chobani-raises-750-million-in-debt-from-tpg\/\">received a loan<\/a>\u00a0from TPG Capital, a\u00a0<a class=\"meta-classifier\" title=\"More articles about private equity.\" href=\"https:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/subjects\/p\/private_equity\/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\">private equity<\/a>\u00a0firm, the company\u2019s value was estimated at $3 billion to $5 billion. At the $3 billion valuation, the average employee payout would be $150,000. The earliest employees, though, will most likely be given many more shares, possibly worth over $1 million.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"273\" data-total-count=\"1919\">Rich Lake, lead project manager, was one of the original group of five employees Mr. Ulukaya hired for the plant in New Berlin. Mr. Lake said on Tuesday that he did not expect Chobani shares to change his life much. \u201cI\u2019m not one for living outside my means,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"107\" data-total-count=\"2026\">Rather, he said, the shares are an acknowledgment of what he and the other employees have put into Chobani.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"152\" data-total-count=\"2178\">\u201cIt\u2019s better than a bonus or a raise,\u201d Mr. Lake said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing because you\u2019re getting a piece of this thing you helped build.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-para-count=\"152\" data-total-count=\"2178\">&#8230;<\/p>\n<p data-para-count=\"152\" data-total-count=\"2178\">Read full NY Times article <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/04\/27\/business\/a-windfall-for-chobani-employees-stakes-in-the-company.html?mcubz=3\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A beautiful gesture by one man given a chance to live out his dreams in America&#8230; At Chobani, Now It\u2019s Not Just the Yogurt That\u2019s Rich NEW BERLIN, N.Y. \u2014 The 2,000 full-time employees of the yogurt company Chobani were handed quite the surprise on Tuesday: an ownership stake that could make some of them [&hellip;]<\/p>\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/2016\/04\/want-see-america\/\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":"","spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false},"categories":[11],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.0.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Isn&#039;t this what America is all about? - Uniting NC<\/title>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/2016\/04\/want-see-america\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Isn&#039;t this what America is all about? - Uniting NC\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"A beautiful gesture by one man given a chance to live out his dreams in America&#8230; At Chobani, Now It\u2019s Not Just the Yogurt That\u2019s Rich NEW BERLIN, N.Y. \u2014 The 2,000 full-time employees of the yogurt company Chobani were handed quite the surprise on Tuesday: an ownership stake that could make some of them [&hellip;]\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/2016\/04\/want-see-america\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Uniting NC\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2016-04-28T12:23:41+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2017-09-09T19:41:22+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Chobani-story-1024x682.png\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"2 minutes\">\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/home\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/home\/\",\"name\":\"Uniting NC\",\"description\":\"Building Community.
