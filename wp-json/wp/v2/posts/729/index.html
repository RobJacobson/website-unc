The prize is awarded to non-profits that promote peace and cross-cultural understanding. And in Uniting NC&#8217;s case, the judges told us they were impressed with how much we&#8217;ve done with such a tiny budget and staff.<\/p>\n<p>This prize is an incredible honor for us, but more than that, it is a recognition of just how far we have come in the past year. When I began working for Uniting NC last March, it was run by a volunteer board with a lot of great ideas but very little time to put them into action. They had created a lovely website and several videos, they had put up billboards around the state, and they had collaborated with other groups on a couple of events. But for the most part, they were still an unknown quantity in North Carolina. I had my doubts about whether this organization would even exist six months later.<\/p>\n<p>But in the past year, I have  watched a very small  group of people \u2014 most of them volunteers \u2014 work like crazy to make this  vision of building respect and understanding of our state&#8217;s diverse cultures more than a good-intentioned fantasy. Together, we have figured  out everything from the ground up. Fund raising, event planning, social  networking, volunteer coordinating, sales. We had no idea how to do  these things, but we did them anyway. There were plenty of people who told us we wouldn&#8217;t succeed, or who just wouldn&#8217;t return our calls, but we kept going. We finished 2010 with more than 20  events under our belts and a broad base of  supporters. Our proudest  moment came in October, when more than 275 people packed a  screening of the film &#8220;Welcome to Shelbyville&#8221; in Cary. We had come a long way from the days when we  were begging 15 people to show up for an event.<\/p>\n<p>This year, there is even more in the works. We are building partnerships with community groups. We are expanding our pool of volunteers and now have a volunteer coordinator. We are building a Uniting NC chapter at NC State University. And so much more. Now, sometimes when I mention Uniting NC to the people I meet, they have heard of it. We see this prize as confirmation that the people of North Carolina care about this work and want it to continue.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday evening, we accepted the award while surrounded by former Peace Corps volunteers \u2014 a group with a deep collective understanding of just how much good each person can do in the world. We left that night with full hearts, knowing that we live in a state were people believe that every human being is deserving of respect, and that there is something to be gained by trying to understand each others&#8217; stories.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Saturday, at a ceremony at Duke University, Uniting NC accepted the N.C.
