You leave everything else behind \u2014 documentation, momentos, diplomas. You walk for days, hiding and trying to keep your family alive. Eventually you reach a tent city where a friendly face offers you shelter, food and water. It\u2019s not home, but it\u2019s safe. You live there for months or even years. Your children go to school in this camp. Your basic needs are provided for, but have no opportunity to work or even to leave the camp. If you are caught outside the camp you may be imprisoned.<\/p>\n<p>You want a better future then living in this camp and you cannot return to your own country. You have the opportunity to resettle in the U.S. or Europe. You apply and are chosen for resettlement in the U.S. It\u2019s like winning the lottery, because less then 1 percent of people in these camps get the opportunity for resettlement. You are told you are going to\u00a0 North Carolina.Before you leave you receive medical and security clearance and cultural orientation classes. You have been in the camp for so long, that you are scared to go, but know this is the way to a better life.<\/p>\n<p>After a very long plane ride, you arrive in North Carolina with one suitcase per person and a plastic bag with all your important documentation. You are met at the airport by a friendly face, your case manager, and an interpreter who speaks your language.\u00a0 They take you to your new apartment, which is furnished with hand-me-down items. It it is the first real home you have had in years, and you are extremely happy with it. You are taken to get a meal and left in the apartment to settle in.<\/p>\n<p>The next day the case manager returns and takes you to the resettlement agency (one of seven in North Carolina). There it becomes apparent just how quickly you are expected to settle in. You need to enroll in English class right away. Despite not speaking the language,and having very few skills, you are expected to be fully self sufficient within three to four months. You are overwhelmed . You begin to wonder if this was such a good idea.\u00a0 You live in a strange place with so many new things to figure out and so little time to do it.<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to the life of a refugee.<\/p>\n<p>June 20 is World Refugee Day. A refugee is a person outside his or her country who cannot return because of political, racial or religious persecution. The definition has recently expanded to include those displaced by war or natural disaster. Resettlement agencies in North Carolina provide services to approximately 2,043 refugees per year.\u00a0 They are spread all over the state.<\/p>\n<p>Too often, refugees are overlooked or treated as unwanted trespassers in the polarized debate about immigration.\u00a0 Refugees are here legally and have the right to work upon arrival. They come from all over the world and may very well be your neighbors. The next time the immigration debate becomes rancorous, think about the family described above and the agencies that with few resources manage to turn refugees into productive, contributing members of the North Carolina economy.<\/p>\n<p>Resettlement agencies rely heavily on volunteers and donations of goods.\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncdhhs.gov\/dss\/refugee\/nc_refugee_service_providers.htm\">This link from the\u00a0 North Carolina Department of Social Services<\/a> provides a listing of resettlement agencies across the state.\u00a0 Contact one of them and find out how you can help.
