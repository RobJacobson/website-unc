This rural Wayne County town is getting an international reputation for being welcoming\u00a0 to its newest residents, a fast-growing group of Haitian immigrants who have come to work in the Butterball turkey plant. In January, the News &amp; Observer&#8217;s Mandy Locke wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsobserver.com\/2012\/01\/22\/1796338\/haitians-flock-to-mount-olive.html\">a story about Mount Olive&#8217;s transformation<\/a>. And last week, the BBC produced an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-us-canada-17039167\">in-depth video<\/a> about the town&#8217;s efforts to integrate its new residents.<\/p>\n<p>It would have been easy for Mount Olive to go the way of so many other small towns, which have reacted to waves of immigrants with fear and anger. Like most immigrants who have flocked to unskilled jobs in rural America, many of the Haitians in Mount Olive are poor, live in overcrowded and rundown housing, don&#8217;t speak English and don&#8217;t understand the laws or culture of their new homes. They are a population that would have been easy to demonize.<\/p>\n<p>But in Mount Olive, town leaders chose to respond to these newcomers with compassion. Instead of writing the Haitians off as lawless or dangerous, town leaders put themselves in their shoes. What is it like to escape one of Earth&#8217;s poorest countries? What is it like to come to a foreign country to work a dirty, bloody and exhausting job and sleep on the floor of a rundown house? Those questions led them to compassionate action. They decided to figure out how they could help their new residents assimilate and thrive. The town manager and a local pastor went door to door, introducing themselves to the Haitians and asking a simple question, &#8220;What do you need?&#8221; They were offering not charity, but the resources to become productive and law-abiding citizens.<\/p>\n<p>This is the question every town in America needs to be asking of its newest residents. We are a global society now, and it is fruitless to rail against immigration. Today, our neighbors are as likely to come from across the world as from across town. When we accept these demographic shifts, we can start to ask the questions that move us forward. How can we help our new residents learn our culture and laws, find safe places to live, work and worship and be productive members of our communities? How can we build communities that allow everyone to contribute? These are the questions that will make us safer and more prosperous in the 21st century.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The little town of Mount Olive has been in the news lately, and for the most refreshing of reasons.
