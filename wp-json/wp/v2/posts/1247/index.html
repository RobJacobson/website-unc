Is it a young blue collar worker, someone who works construction or does housecleaning, who speaks little English? It&#8217;s probably not a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who has written for the Washington Post, the New Yorker and the Huffington Post.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the New York Times Magazine published a fascinating first-person article authored by Jose Antonio Vargas, a well-known journalist, in which he reveals a secret he has kept for nearly two decades. He is an undocumented immigrant from the Phillipines, who was brought to this country when he was 12 years old by a man his family told him was his uncle. He quickly adapted and learned to love his new home. But when he was 16, he found out that the man was not his uncle. The man was someone his family had paid, using hard-earned savings, to get him into the United States. That&#8217;s also when he found out that his green card and other immigration documents were fake.<\/p>\n<p>Vargas joins a growing number of young people, brought to the United States as children, who are going public with their immigration status. Many are smart and ambitious. They are student body presidents, business owners, talented orators. By stepping out of the shadows, they are blowing up sterotypes and reminding us, once again, that everyone has a story. These are stories we should hear before we make our judgments about how best to deal with the problem of illegal immigration.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are believed to be 11 million undocumented immigrants in the  United States,&#8221; Vargas writes. &#8220;We\u2019re not always who you think we are. Some pick your  strawberries or care for your children. Some are in high school or  college. And some, it turns out, write news articles you might read. I  grew up here. This is my home. Yet even though I think of myself as an  American and consider America my country, my country doesn\u2019t think of me  as one of its own.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/06\/26\/magazine\/my-life-as-an-undocumented-immigrant.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;hp\">Read the whole article here<\/a>, and tell us what you think.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What image do you see when you think of an undocumented immigrant?
