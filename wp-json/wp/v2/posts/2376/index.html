Thousands\u00a0from all walks of life, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, have gathered at vigils.

What does it mean that this could happen to\u00a0these three exemplary young people, so widely loved and admired?\u00a0As much as I love my life here in North Carolina and want to be a citizen of this country, it does make me pause and reinforces thoughts I have everyday: Do people want me here? Am I welcome? Is this a place that I can lead a happy, productive life?<\/p>\n<p>Then I recently heard what Yusor Abu-Salha herself had to say, and it made me feel a little more hopeful. Last summer, she recorded these words, which speak so clearly to both her own welcoming and gracious spirit and our shared hopes for\u00a0our community and our country: \u201cGrowing up in America has been such a blessing\u2026 although in some ways I do stand out.. there\u2019s still so many ways that I feel embedded in the fabric that is our culture. And that\u2019s the beautiful thing here that it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from there\u2019s so many different people from so many different places, of different backgrounds and religions. But here we\u2019re all one. One culture and it\u2019s beautiful to see people of different areas interacting and being family, being one community.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As we grieve for the devastating loss of three young people from our community, and all the joy they had brought their families, friends and classmates, and all their dreams and potential, can we\u00a0find solace in knowing that we are not alone?
