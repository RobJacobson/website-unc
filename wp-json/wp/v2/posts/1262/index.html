Before that day in 1999, he had never spoken to an immigrant and disdained people who didn&#8217;t speak English.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A brown-skinned couple caught his eye. From the way they leaned  toward each other, he knew they were deeply in love. Words tumbled from  their mouths \u2014 a series of sounds without meaning for Bridges. He  listened anyway, wishing he could understand.<\/p>\n<p>He spotted them  walking outside the store, plastic grocery bags in hand. &#8220;Do ya&#8217;ll wanna  lift?&#8221; he asked. They looked at him quizzically, so he tried again, &#8220;Do  ya&#8217;ll wanna ride?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The couple and another man piled into his  car, pointing the way to their destination a few miles away: two rundown  trailers in the middle of a cotton field. Bridges dropped them off and  went home to make dinner.<\/p>\n<p>But he couldn&#8217;t get what he&#8217;d seen out of his mind. Nearly 30 people lived in the two trailers.<\/p>\n<p>A  few hours later, Bridges went back to the cotton field, carrying  lasagna and his daughter&#8217;s Spanish-English dictionary. It was the  beginning of a whirlwind journey into a new world that would change his  life.<\/p>\n<p>People he had never noticed embraced him. They taught him  new words, served him soup and showed him the pictures of their children  taped to the trailer&#8217;s walls.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It made me realize that I need to take another look at myself. &#8230; It really brought out the &#8216;me&#8217; in me,&#8221; he said.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Uniting NC doesn&#8217;t tell anyone what to believe about immigration. But we do want to give people the opportunity to do what Paul Bridges has done \u2014 to meet immigrants and to understand them as fellow human beings \u2014 and then to decide what their beliefs are.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Check out this CNN story about Paul Bridges, a small-town Republican mayor in Georgia who has become an outspoken advocate for immigrants.
