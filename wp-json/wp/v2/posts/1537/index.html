It seems like a long time ago that I nervously took the job as its first director, knowing I would have to learn the world of non-profits from the ground up. At the time, Uniting NC was a very young group run by volunteers. It was just taking its first steps.<\/p>\n<p>In the two and a half years since, Uniting NC has grown up. We now have two staff members, dozens of loyal volunteers, more than 100 donors and thousands of supporters. We have helped organize more than 50 events, run a successful statewide billboard campaign, produced videos and radio public service announcements, launched a Business Circle and won two statewide awards for our work. I am proud to say that \u2014 thanks to the work of a dedicated board and many generous volunteers and donors \u2014 we are making a difference, helping people see each other as human beings with similar hopes and fears, rather than as stereotypes or scapegoats.<\/p>\n<p>I have been honored to work alongside so many great people and to do work in which I believe so strongly. To everyone who has helped me along the way, I cannot thank you enough. But now it is time for me to turn this job over to a new leader, someone with fresh energy to take Uniting NC to the next level. I\u2019ll be moving on to another non-profit to pursue my love of writing and storytelling. I hope to use the skills I developed over many years in the news business to help causes that I believe make North Carolina, and the world, a more just, humane and enjoyable place to live.<\/p>\n<p>I am so excited that Dan Rearick will take the director\u2019s spot. He is not only a smart and talented Harvard-educated lawyer, he is also passionate about Uniting NC\u2019s work. He truly believes that we, the regular people of North Carolina, have the power to build safe, prosperous, connected communities that honor the essential worth of everyone who lives in them. Dan was a founding board member of Uniting NC, and I have seen him give hundreds of hours to this organization without complaint. He is unfailingly excited about Uniting NC\u2019s mission, and willing to do the hard work it takes to achieve it. I\u2019ll be on the sidelines cheering him and Uniting NC on. I will always love and support this great organization.<\/p>\n<p><em>If you want to keep in touch, my personal email address is kristincollins10@gmail.com.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I write this, I am finishing up my last week as director of Uniting NC.
