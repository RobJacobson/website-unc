But they are also a time for cultivating a spirit of giving, a time of kindness and warmth, a time of welcoming. And no one needs those gifts more than the tens of thousands of immigrants and refugees who call North Carolina home.<\/p>\n<p>Last week, I attended the holiday open house at <a href=\"https:\/\/uscri.refugees.org\/site\/PageNavigator\/Raleigh\/home\">USCRI<\/a>, an agency that resettles refugees in North Carolina. The people who gathered to munch on Christmas cookies in USCRI&#8217;s Raleigh office had been forced from their countries by civil war, violence and oppressive governments. Many spent years in refugee camps. Most had lost or left behind family. They arrived in North Carolina with no choice but to start their lives over from scratch. They had walked a long road to get to that Christmas party.<\/p>\n<p>This holiday season and in the year to come, we&#8217;re asking you to think about how you can welcome immigrants and refugees and make even one person&#8217;s journey a little less arduous. How can you make a connection with someone who comes from someplace else? How can you understand another person&#8217;s experience a little more fully? How can you make someone feel a little less isolated?<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Special Request<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you are Colombian, we have an opportunity for you right now. Two months ago, USCRI moved Maria and her two children, refugees from Colombia, into a Raleigh apartment. Maria is a single mother, working as a temp and struggling to learn English. But with Christmas approaching, she is desperately missing home. &#8220;She is just so alone,&#8221; said USCRI Raleigh Director Shirley Thoms. &#8220;She says she hasn&#8217;t met any other Colombians.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Thoms says Maria would very much appreciate a holiday visit from another Colombian (preferably a woman), just to help ease her homesickness. Are you are Colombian? Would you be willing to meet Maria and her children and help them feel welcome in their new home? If so, please email <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/contact-us\/\">kristin@unitingnc.org<\/a>, and I will put you in touch.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For the Rest of Us&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you are not Colombian, we will have plenty of other opportunities in the coming year for you to get involved with welcoming newcomers from around the world.
