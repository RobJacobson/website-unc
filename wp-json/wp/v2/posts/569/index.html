Certainly there is nothing wrong with discussing, in a civil manner, the best way to develop land near the site of the attacks to avoid division and hard feelings. But many seem to think the debate gives them a right to rail against Muslim Americans in general.<\/p>\n<p>One pastor in Florida now says he plans to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsobserver.com\/2010\/08\/26\/648133\/pastor-ill-burn-qurans.html\">burn copies of the Quran<\/a>. The pastor&#8217;s church has only 50 members, and he is certainly a part of the fringes of this debate, but his announcement has earned him nationwide attention \u2014 and inspired even more mean-spirited shouting that fails to uphold the American promise of freedom of religion.<\/p>\n<p>Muslim leaders in North Carolina say they have also been targets. Khalilah Sabra, director of Raleigh&#8217;s Muslim American Society, said protesters have gathered outside one mosque and another has been vandalized. She also said she has received insulting and threatening calls about a Muslim community center being planned in Raleigh.<\/p>\n<p>Freedom of religion has always been a defining feature of our American democracy, and for centuries now, people from around the world have come to this land in order to practice their religion freely.<\/p>\n<p>But at this particular moment, we may not be living up to our ideals.\u00a0 As Sabra says: &#8220;Muslims seem to be going from bad to worse\u2014marginalized by beliefs  and\u00a0religious  concepts\u00a0that do not differ so much from Christianity or Judaism.  The law pronounces the Muslim equal, abstractly, but their conditions  in social society are still far from equal to those of other faiths.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recently Muslim Americans, including Muslim North Carolinians, have felt under attack.
