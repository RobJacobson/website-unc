Tanton is the man behind the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), Numbers USA and the Center for Immigration Studies \u2014 all familiar names to anyone in the immigration world. Those groups have enormous clout and have taken extremely controversial stands on a host of immigration issues. But what fascinated me most about this article was the story of Tanton&#8217;s personal evolution from a liberal environmentalist who supported the Sierra Club and Planned Parenthood to an anti-immigration zealot who has expressed white supremacist views. (All the groups he helped found denounce these views, and since the story ran, Tanton has resigned from the board of FAIR.)<\/p>\n<p>This paragraph stood out the most for me:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Petoskey [Michigan], population 6,000, hugs Lake Michigan in a forested area known  for sailboats and summer homes. Dr. Tanton has spent most of his adult  life there, chopping wood, keeping bees and growing kale. Even as late  as 2000, the surrounding county was 94 percent white.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It made me wonder whether John Tanton, perhaps one of our nation&#8217;s most influential voices on immigration, has ever really known an immigrant. Has he ever sat down to a meal with people from other countries? Has he ever talked to a woman who wears a hijab? Has he ever heard the story, first-hand, of a Mexican immigrant&#8217;s journey to the United States? Is he able to see immigrants as anything other than faceless statistics?<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know the answers to these questions, but it seems fairly likely that the answer is no. My guess is that, if he had ever really understood people of other races and nationalities, he would not have written to a friend that &#8220;for  European-American society and culture to persist requires a  European-American majority, and a clear one at that.\u201d He would not have written to a donor, &#8220;One of my prime concerns is about the decline of folks who look like you and me.&#8221; And he would not have expressed support for eugenics.<\/p>\n<p>I wish there had been someone, or some group like Uniting NC, who could have helped Tanton see that, no matter where we come from or what we look like, we are all people with something to give to the world.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A couple weekends ago, the New York Times ran a fascinating profile of John Tanton, the man who helped start three prominent national groups that push for tighter limits on immigration.
