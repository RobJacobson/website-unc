This week, the N&amp;O\u2019s Yonat Shimron <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsobserver.com\/2011\/02\/06\/971138\/study-blunts-fear-of-muslims.html\">wrote about a study<\/a> showing that, despite fears that Muslim Americans are widely involved in terrorism, fewer than 70 Muslim Americans have been arrested for terror-related crimes in the past two years. That\u2019s a tiny sliver of the millions of Muslims living peacefully in our country.<\/p>\n<p>A few weeks earlier, Shimron <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsobserver.com\/2011\/01\/13\/916994\/a-believer-in-hope.html#storylink=misearch\">wrote about David Sterling<\/a>, a convert to Islam who does not fit into the traditional view of Muslims. Sterling is a native-born white American who converted from Judaism. That alone is enough to topple many stereotypes. Sterling\u2019s conversion came after dabbling in faiths including Hare Krishna and Tibetan Buddhism.<\/p>\n<p>His journey reminds us why so many struggle to come here. He had the freedom to explore and choose the way of life that works best for him. He says himself that he could not be a Muslim in the Middle East. He is happiest in the United States where he had the freedom to convert and also has the freedom to practice his religion as he sees fit.<\/p>\n<p>It is natural for us to fear what we do not understand, and most in our country have a long way to go in understanding Muslims. Yet, Sterling \u2014 by virtue of who he is, and where he came from \u2014 will not let us settle into stereotypes. He is a reminder to all of us that under labels there are humans. The work of Uniting NC, and the David Sterlings of the world, is to remind each of us that we have far more in common than not.<\/p>\n<p>When we meet a 58-year-old Brooklyn born American Muslim, we see that life is not as simple as the labels. And, hopefully, that inspires us to reach out to those we do not understand and attempt to understand.<\/p>\n<p>As David Sterling himself said, \u201cStanding on level ground, we are all the same in the end.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Please don&#8217;t forget about our fundraising challenge.
