We are one of 19 state affiliates of the umbrella organization <a href=\"https:\/\/www.welcomingamerica.org\/\">Welcoming America<\/a>. We are a network of groups across the country \u2014 from California to Nebraska to Texas to Rhode Island to Alabama \u2014 that are working to build communities that respect and welcome immigrants. But I&#8217;ll admit that, with us all being so far apart, even I sometimes forget that Uniting NC is not in this alone.<\/p>\n<p>Then, last week I went to Seattle for Welcoming America&#8217;s annual conference, and all that changed. At the conference, I saw in the flesh what an exciting and growing movement this is. Just in the past year, the number of state affiliates has grown by nearly 50 percent, from 13 to 19. A diverse array of people have become involved, from state legislators to religious leaders to stand-up comics. National foundations are taking notice of the work. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.welcomingamerica.org\/resources\/rci\/\">our unique approach<\/a> \u2014 which focuses on facilitating understanding among longtime residents, rather than just serving new immigrants \u2014 is, arguably, the leading edge of the movement to integrate immigrants into American society.<\/p>\n<p>The conference showed me that we are the mainstream. People who believe that, in the United States, every person should have a fair chance to succeed. People who believe that no one should be judged based on their religion, their skin color or their country of origin. People who believe that diversity strengthens and enriches our country. We are the mainstream \u2014 and we have the power to put our ideals into action.<\/p>\n<p>We often feel powerless over the big issues that affect our lives and our society. The average person can&#8217;t heal our hopelessly polarized political system, solve our country&#8217;s economic woes or fix its health care system. But we can work to make our communities places that believe in the dignity of every person. We can come together over dinner and talk over our differences. We can host book discussions and dialogues and multi-cultural potlucks. We can reach out to people who look different from us and learn how their stories mirror our own. We can erect billboards that portray immigrants as human beings. And, little by little, if we keep working at it, we can make things better.<\/p>\n<p>Need ideas about how to make your community more welcoming for newcomers? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.welcomingamerica.org\/friends\/\">Go here.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Did you know that Uniting NC is part of a national movement?
