Residents complain of hearing Spanish in Wal-Mart and needing interpreters at school events. They say immigrants are driving up crime, though there are no statistics broken down by race and ethnicity to prove their suspicions.<\/p>\n<p>When I was a news reporter, I frequently heard identical complaints in North Carolina communities. People felt threatened by seeing Spanish signs outside businesses and didn&#8217;t like not being able to understand their fellow shoppers at Wal-Mart. They talked of immigrant-led crime waves, when statistics showed that crime in their communities had decreased.<\/p>\n<p>They had started thinking of immigrants as hostile invaders rather than human beings.<\/p>\n<p>Here in North Carolina, let&#8217;s not allow fear and anger to rip apart our communities. Let&#8217;s work together to recognize our common humanity, and make that the foundation for finding a solution to the problem of illegal immigration.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A recent story in the New York Times reveals how a fight over immigration is creating a deep divide in a small Nebraska town.
