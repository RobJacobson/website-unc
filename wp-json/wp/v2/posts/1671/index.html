We held an average of one event every two weeks, reaching nearly 2,000 North Carolinians. We also had billboards and radio PSAs across the state, sharing a message of mutual respect and cooperation between U.S.-born Americans and new immigrant neighbors.<\/p>\n<p>Now as 2012 comes to an end, we are hearing a lot about changing demographics in America. Earlier this year, we learned that for the first time in, well, a long time, the majority of people born in the United States aren&#8217;t white. And recently, we are again hearing a lot of talk from all sides about doing something to fix our nation&#8217;s immigration system.<\/p>\n<p>But the law is not all that matters. One need only look back at big legal changes of the past like <em>Brown v. Board<\/em>, ending our country&#8217;s policy of &#8216;separate but equal.&#8217; Top-down changes in the law can be necessary, but they can&#8217;t accomplish everything we had hoped without changes in the way we work together as people in our individual states, towns, schools and churches.<\/p>\n<p>So as we look toward 2013, we see a lot of work to be done to make our state a place in which all North Carolinians feel welcome and to build stronger, more productive communities. And we look forward to doing it together with you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2012 has been a busy year for Uniting NC.
