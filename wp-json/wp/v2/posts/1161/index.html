Donations are pouring into relief funds. When something catastrophic happens in another country, we all turn our attention to that part of the world. We naturally want to help. We feel a sense of unity with those in the affected area of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, for some of us, attitudes change when the world comes to us. We sympathize with those who have been the victims of a catastrophe as long as they stay in their country and deal with it.\u00a0 When people want to come here to escape disaster, violence, poverty or persecution, hearts harden and attitudes change.\u00a0 It becomes us and them, rather than just us.<\/p>\n<p>Two weeks ago I was on a cruise ship with my family in the southern Caribbean. One of our stops was the island of St. Lucia. The island is breathtaking, but incredibly poor. Its main industries are tourism and bananas. We drove through fishing villages with no running water. It was laundry day and a parade of women walked to the river with their laundry baskets on their heads. I had never seen the level of poverty I witnessed on this island.<\/p>\n<p>That tour brought home to me the reality of what many people are leaving when they immigrate to the United States. For people fleeing poverty, oppression and disaster, immigration is ultimately an act of desperation.\u00a0 They leave behind all that they know because they see no other option.\u00a0 This awareness and sensitivity is what is missing from the highly politicized immigration debates we have in this country.\u00a0 Uniting NC is working to bring a more compassionate, empathetic view to the forefront.\u00a0 I hope that in the very near future we will respond to immigrants the way we are responding the Japanese in their moment of need, and remember that we truly are all one people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A guest post from volunteer Melissa Bellitto: Last week\u2019s earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and the disaster that is continuing to unfold there, serve as a reminder to all of us: We are all one people, sharing a very small planet.\u00a0 Instantaneous communication reminds us of this fact.\u00a0 Twitter is awash with thoughts, prayers, affirmations [&hellip;]<\/p>\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/2011\/03\/sharing-a-small-planet\/\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":"","spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.0.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Sharing a small planet - Uniting NC<\/title>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/2011\/03\/sharing-a-small-planet\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Sharing a small planet - Uniting NC\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"A guest post from volunteer Melissa Bellitto: Last week\u2019s earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and the disaster that is continuing to unfold there, serve as a reminder to all of us: We are all one people, sharing a very small planet.\u00a0 Instantaneous communication reminds us of this fact.\u00a0 Twitter is awash with thoughts, prayers, affirmations [&hellip;]\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/2011\/03\/sharing-a-small-planet\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Uniting NC\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2011-03-14T15:29:50+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2011-03-14T16:02:12+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"2 minutes\">\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/home\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/home\/\",\"name\":\"Uniting NC\",\"description\":\"Building Community.
