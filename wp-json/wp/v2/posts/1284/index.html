The men make vulgar comments about women.<\/p>\n<p>The cast says it\u2019s all meant in the spirit of fun, and some fans with Russian roots say the show is an accurate depiction of one aspect of Russian culture \u2014 just like the popular \u201cJersey Shore\u201d shows only one small slice of the culture of New Jersey.<\/p>\n<p>Others are outraged at the misrepresentation of their culture and offended that the show makes all Russians look like \u201cprostitutes and criminals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>These immigrants are not the first minority group to be exploited and stereotyped for the sake of &#8220;reality&#8221; television.

With these kinds of\u00a0 extreme images of immigrants being promoted in the media and on TV, we must work even harder to show people the true picture.<\/p>\n<p>Immigrants cannot be shoe-horned into stereotypes. They are not all good or all bad. They are just people, and should be treated as individuals.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guest post from Uniting NC assistant Francisco Chavez.
