Suddenly, people who came from other countries or practiced different religions seemed like a threat. Muslim-Americans felt singled out for anger and discrimination. Jewish-Americans were stung by a new wave of anti-Semitism. And immigrants from around the world faced a far more daunting legal process, along with rising anti-immigrant sentiment.<\/p>\n<p>Many of those divisions and prejudices still linger today, but on the tenth anniversary of the attacks, a diverse group of North Carolinians is coming together to heal old wounds. Muslim, Jewish and Christian volunteers from across Wake County have teamed up to build a house for Habitat for Humanity. They call the interfaith project Abraham Build, and organizers say they hope it will change the lives of the volunteers as much as it does the new homeowners.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The most effective way to combat bigotry is to build community, and  there is no better way to build community than to work together for the  common good,&#8221; said David LaMotte, of the N.C. Council of Churches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>On Sunday, the anniversary of the 9\/11 attacks,\u00a0 Abraham Build volunteers are inviting the public to join them in a celebration of healing and reconciliation.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All are welcome to gather at 8: 30 a.m. at the site of the Abraham Build house: <a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=515+Parnell+Drive,+Raleigh,+NC&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=35.768383,-78.605204&amp;spn=0.019535,0.038581&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=38.963048,79.013672&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;z=15\">515 Parnell Drive in Raleigh&#8217;s Long Acres neighborhood<\/a>.
