There are many things that I enjoy about Uniting NC, but our students will always be at the very top of my list. However brief, I\u2019m grateful for the moments spent in their company. \u00a0I feel lucky to know them, be privy to the bits of life they share, and be part of the dreams that I see them marching closer to with each passing day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While every student is different, each possesses resilience and determination. It doesn\u2019t matter where our students are coming from; what matters is the direction they are going. Hint: it is always up, forward, and ready to face the world\u2019s twists and turns around the corner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now I\u2019m reading through the applications for our upcoming Code the Dream course in the spring. In the over 100 applications submitted so far, the life stories of potential students vary in many ways; some came to the US from other places in pursuit of dreams that previously seemed impossible, some are single mothers and fathers wanting a better life for their kids, some are overcoming poverty and even times of homelessness, and some are simply in search of a fresh start to make their mark on the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In them, I recognize the same resilience I\u2019ve seen in our current and past students. I know I can\u2019t wait to meet them and see what beginnings the New Year will bring to their lives.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I sit in our office today, I find myself reflecting on my almost four months with Uniting NC &#8211;all that I\u2019ve learned about myself, and the incredible perseverance I\u2019ve seen in others.
