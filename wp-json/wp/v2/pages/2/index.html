While North Carolina always felt like home, Dan also spent time studying or working in France, Bolivia, Puerto Rico and Tanzania. After a number of years in both public and private sector legal work, he returned to North Carolina in 2008, where he saw how, more and more, it was possible now to meet people from all around the world right here at home. Having met so many people from around the world, Dan is well aware of how hard they worked and continue to work to make a better life for their families, and how proud they are to call North Carolina home. He is happy to have the opportunity to work with North Carolinians, old and new, to learn from one another and to make North Carolina an even greater place to live.
