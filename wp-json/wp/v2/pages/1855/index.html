Now more than one in eight Americans is an immigrant. And in many parts of the country more than one in four children have immigrant parents. Teachers report that immigrant parents are incredibly motivated and want the best for their children. However, a number of barriers \u2013 language foremost among them \u2013 prevent immigrant parents from engaging in their children\u2019s educations via traditional means.<\/p>\n<p>Parental engagement is one of the strongest indicators of their children\u2019s success in schools. So what\u2019s the best way for parents to get involved in their children\u2019s educations? Probably the most traditional way is to get involved in the PTA. But for parents whose first language is not English, trying to follow rapid-fire discussion in English can be intimidating. For many, despite the fact that they care deeply about their children\u2019s education, it\u2019s enough to keep them away.<\/p>\n<p><b>Solution:<\/b>\u00a0Uniting NC\u2019s \u2018PAL\u2019 program (\u2018Pareja de Aprendizaje y Liderazgo\u2019 or Learning and Leading Partners) pairs English-speaking and Spanish-speaking parents to meet weekly for language exchange, to discuss their children\u2019s education, and share a bit of their own background and culture. In addition to the weekly meet-ups in pairs, parents participate in monthly meetings with Uniting NC staff and school teachers and administrators.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2020\" alt=\"PALpinata\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/PALpinata-300x199.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/PALpinata-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/PALpinata.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Designed together with teachers and parents, the PAL program offers an alternative means for parents to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Gain a more complete and ongoing understanding of their children\u2019s educational goals and curriculum.<\/li>\n<li>Better understand the school and community services available to them.<\/li>\n<li>Exchange ideas about how they can better support their children\u2019s education.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><a title=\"Contact\" href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/contact\/\">Let us know<\/a> if your school would like to apply to participate or if you&#8217;d like more information.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The PAL Program: Working together to improve our schools.
