We are building a state-wide corps of volunteers working to make their communities more inclusive of all people.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to volunteer, the first step is to <a href=\"https:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin?v=001Vjt3cCjZco9Bx1csWWHEy62W9TlrXjZ9\" target=\"_blank\">join our volunteer list<\/a>. You will begin getting notices of future training sessions, as well as volunteer newsletters and occasional requests for help.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in planning or hosting an event, you can jump right in by looking at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/get-involved\/host-an-event\/\">this guide<\/a> and contacting us.<\/p>\n<p>Below are a few other ways volunteers can help Uniting NC, but don&#8217;t consider this a complete list. We are always open to your ideas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Facilitate an event<\/strong><br \/>\nMaybe you aren\u2019t quite ready to host your own event. You can still help us. We get lots of groups throughout the year who ask us to help them put on events. They often want people to give a brief presentation about Uniting NC or facilitate a discussion. Come to a training session, and then we can call on you occasionally to help us handle an event. This will allow us to commit to more events each year. Please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/contact\/\">let us know<\/a> if you&#8217;re interested in attending a future training session.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Raise money for a billboard<\/strong><br \/>\nWe have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/stories\/billboards\/\">a couple images<\/a> for use on billboards and are developing more. All of them focus on humanizing immigrants. If you want to see a positive message about immigrants in your community, then work with us to figure out the price of a billboard and then help us raise the money to make it happen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Offer your skills to Uniting NC<\/strong><br \/>\nAs an organization with only one part-time staff member, we need help in all kinds of areas. If you have expertise in any of the following areas, please consider volunteering a couple hours a month to help us with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing:\u00a0We would love to build a team who we can call on to write blog posts, letters to the editor and op-eds.<\/li>\n<li>Internet and social media:\u00a0We are always looking to build our online presence through our website, Facebook and other online tools.<\/li>\n<li>Graphic design:\u00a0We often need people to help us design fliers, promotional materials and billboards. We would love to have a group of people to share the work.<\/li>\n<li>Advertising:\u00a0We need help figuring out how to get our PSAs, billboards and videos out into the world on a limited budget.<\/li>\n<li>Fundraising:\u00a0If you know how to fundraise, we would love to have your help. You can raise money for something specific, like a Uniting NC billboard in your community, or just help us raise money to continue our work in general. We also have T-shirts you can sell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Uniting NC is a small non-profit with a very small staff.
