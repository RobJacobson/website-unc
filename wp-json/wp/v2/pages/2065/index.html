Many congregations and faith communities feel strongly about welcoming the foreigner and stranger among us as part of being a community of faith. But we can still do better.<\/p>\n<p>Fostering welcoming congregations at the level of the individual congregation is important, but it is also important at the communal level. Uniting NC believes that through the Welcoming Congregations network of faith communities, we can make not only our own congregations stronger and more faithful, but also create more unified communities of faith across North Carolina for all peoples.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"clb-button\" title=\"Become a Welcoming Congregation\" href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/welcoming-congregations\/submit\/\">Become a Welcoming Congregation Now<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>What is a Welcoming Congregation? <\/b><\/p>\n<p>A Welcoming Congregation is a community of faith dedicated to creating intentional spaces for dialogue and relationships between those of many different backgrounds and home cultures. These faith communities are involved in participating in one another\u2019s lives though a mutual sharing across languages, cultures and nations in a variety of creative ways. Communities actively engaged in being a welcoming congregation gather together around food, issues of advocacy, worship and service.<\/p>\n<p><b>How to become a Welcoming Congregation? <\/b><\/p>\n<p>Many congregations in North Carolina are already engaged in building relationships and welcoming others. Uniting NC would like to recognize the communities already involved as together we work to create a stronger network of communities in North Carolina. Uniting NC is interested in partnering with congregations who would like to become welcoming congregations or congregations who would like to deepen and strengthen already existing commitments to being communities of welcome.<\/p>\n<p><b>For congregations just starting to explore becoming a Welcoming Congregation, here are a few activities to begin with:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Participate in a one-time facilitated dialogue focused on immigration.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Uniting NC is connected with a variety of trained facilitators and resources for beginning this dialogue in your congregation.
