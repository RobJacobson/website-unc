This can be in your living room, or in a large public venue. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/contact\/\">Contact us<\/a> for more info about how to get a film.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Community Dialogue<\/strong>:\u00a0A facilitated discussion about cultural change and immigration, which encourages people to speak from personal experience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Speaker<\/strong>:\u00a0If you have a willing audience, we can help you find a great speaker who will tell their immigration story.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Community Event<\/strong>:\u00a0Help put together a potluck, service project or social event that brings together immigrants and non-immigrants<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As an event host, we also ask you to think about ways you can attract people who are not already engaged in thinking about immigration and culture. Maybe plan your event as part of an existing one, such as a church service, book club gathering or civic club meeting that would draw people who might not normally come to an immigrant-related event.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to take on one of these projects, we will support you in all kinds of ways. We might be able to give you a small stipend for supplies, provide volunteers to facilitate discussion, loan you a film to show, or give you any advice you need.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re ready to start planning, contact Francisco Chavez, francisco@unitingnc.org.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We need you to take the idea of building respect and understanding and run with it in your community.
