It also suffers from increasing hostility in popular attitudes, discrimination at the hands of law enforcement and other officials, biased educational curricula, tendentious views of history, and the consequences of cultural incomprehension. Although Muslims in America have for the most part remained patriotic and loyal, there is an emerging sense within and outside the community that marginalization and the insecurity born of discrimination could soon result in unmanageable sources of grievance and instability.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the Muslim population is becoming as significant population in America and greater than that other minorities in certain states-Muslim remain relatively ill-understood. Their predicament is little-known among outsiders and non-Muslims. There is even a sense among Muslim themselves that they do not have a handle on what is happening in the very varied Muslim communities throughout America.\u00a0This represents a particular blind spot for US security policy.<\/p>\n<p>The overarching goal of the entire society should be to capacitate conditions for peace and security by: creating awareness in the society of factors affecting peace; addressing myths attributed to religious teachings; research and study into communal and sectarian conflicts; capacity building and peace advocacy, especially among youth; and, supporting women&#8217;s empowerment.<\/p>\n<p> The first step in interrupting this cycle of inequity is mutual engagement. We will not be able to effectively dismantle systems of oppression-systems of inequity-without working in coalition with one another across lines of difference. Yet because of persistent residential and school segregation, the opportunities young people in the United States have had to interact with those racially, ethnically, or religiously different from them have typically been quite limited. This lack of direct experience means that what one learns about the &#8220;other&#8221; is based on secondhand information, information too often conveyed in the form of media stereotypes or parental prejudices. Exactly who the&#8221;other&#8221; is varies, depending on where students have grown up and what their life experience has been. But we can be sure that all members of our campus populations have come to college with stereotypes and prejudices about other segments of the student body. Such preconception is unavoidable when there is so much misinformation circulating. And these biases are a barrier to meaningful engagement across lines of difference.<br \/>\nWhy does engagement matter? It should be clear that diversity is not the end in itself. It is not just about being buddies. It is about being allies and becoming effective agents of change. To work effectively as an agent of change in a pluralistic society, it is necessary to be able to connect with people different from oneself.<\/p>\n"},"link":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/2010\/08\/burning-the-quran-are-we-still-in-america\/#comment-20","status":"approved","type":"comment","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments\/20"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/569"}]}}
