Whatever the motivations of that preacher in Florida he was well within his rights to burn a Koran. Since it was his book it was neither illegal nor worthy of news. He did it for the publicity. More troubling than that though was the demand by Muslim groups that government, institutions, and people in a free society condemn and even criminalize that exercise of free speech. Somehow, I don&#8217;t see &#8220;uniting nc&#8221; or it&#8217;s members demanding censorship of flag burners as is happening with Koran burners. That we now have a campaign of intimidation and threats to stop people from burning the Koran, the situation is different. If offensive or unpopular speech is to be banned or self-censored so as to not offend Muslims burning a Koran becomes a political necessity to save the First Amendment.<\/p>\n"},"link":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/2010\/08\/burning-the-quran-are-we-still-in-america\/#comment-21","status":"approved","type":"comment","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments\/21"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/569"}]}}
