That&#8217;s the question that Charlotte artist Edwin Gil is asking children around the state. Several hundred students across North Carolina are participating in his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edwingil.com\/site\/painting-4-diversity\/\">Painting 4 Diversity<\/a> project, which asks them to create art that conveys their vision of diversity. Edwin is a Colombian immigrant who uses his art to bridge cultural divides in our increasingly diverse society. Last year, he created the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/2011\/03\/creating-a-flag-of-hope\/\">Flag of Hope<\/a>, which some of you participated in.<\/p>\n<p>Uniting NC partnered up with Gil again this year to find Painting 4 Diversity participants in Raleigh, and we decided to take an even broader view than usual of &#8220;diversity.&#8221; That&#8217;s why we invited students at the Gov. Morehead School for the Blind to participate in the art contest. These visually impaired students come from across the state to study, and they represent a broad array of races and backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this week, Edwin traveled to Raleigh so the students could personally present their art to him. On May 5, their art projects will be displayed and judged among hundreds of other entries at an exhibition in Charlotte. But the real prize was watching the excited students show off their artwork to Edwin and his team. It was a special moment where we all learned a little more about what diversity and inclusion really mean.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/DSC_0168.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1441\" title=\"DSC_0168\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/DSC_0168-1024x685.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"614\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/DSC_0168-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/DSC_0168-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/DSC_0168-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/DSC_0168-400x267.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/art1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1444\" title=\"art1\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/art1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"461\" height=\"614\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/art1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/art1-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/art1-112x150.jpg 112w, https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/art1-400x533.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/art1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What do you see when you think about diversity?

Events like this shatter the stereotypes that mosques, and the people who frequent them, are shadowy or secretive, worthy of suspicion and ill-will. When you have chatted and laughed with a Muslim person \u2014 and discovered that they live in your neighborhood, work in your community, send their children to the same schools your children attend \u2014 it&#8217;s difficult to believe the oft-spouted rhetoric that all Muslims are dangerous or hate America, or that mosques represent violence or terrorism. Instead, we see that our Muslim neighbors are people just like us, trying to build a good life for themselves and their families.<\/p>\n<p>Uniting NC was honored to be the only outside community organization participating in the open house. We are so glad we have been able to show our Muslim neighbors that we see them as an important part of an integrated and prosperous North Carolina.

The kind of place where spaghetti is about as foreign a food as you&#8217;ll find on any restaurant menu. And then, everything changes. A crowd of immigrants moves to town to work in the local poultry plant. The immigrants speak different languages, dress differently and keep to themselves. The locals, feeling threatened, start to talk about the newcomers. They are aggressive and mean, they say. They smell bad. They crowd the schools. They bring down property values. Some of the allegations are even published in the local newspaper.<\/p>\n<p>This is the setting of &#8220;Welcome to Shelbyville,&#8221; a new documentary that Uniting NC &#8212; along with our partners, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.museumofthenewsouth.org\/calendar\/detail\/?ProgramId=401&amp;OccurrenceId=498\">Levine Museum of the New South<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/uscri.refugees.org\/site\/PageNavigator\/Field%20Offices\/Raleigh\/RAAboutUs\">USCRI North Carolina<\/a> &#8212; will begin screening in North Carolina next week. (Go to the end of this post for details on how you can attend one of two free screenings in Charlotte and Cary.) The film is about Shelbyville, Tennessee, but it tackles an issue that has affected towns across the South. It is an honest portrait of the fear and divisions that waves of immigration have caused.<\/p>\n<p>The story, however, does not stop there. Many of us just sigh and shake our heads at the way we don&#8217;t know our neighbors anymore. Many of us have become resigned to animosity and fear of the stranger. But in Shelbyville, people came together to change that climate. They held community meetings and potluck dinners. They talked to each other and asked honest questions. They looked past their differences and saw that they were all human, all people who wanted a good life for their families, all people who, in their own way, shared the American dream. Shelbyville is the model for the kind of work that Uniting NC wants to do, and for the way that all of us in North Carolina can get involved.<\/p>\n<p>We hope you will join us for one of these two free screenings:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Levine Museum of the New South, Charlotte<\/strong><br \/>\nThursday, Oct. 21<br \/>\n7 p.m.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.museumofthenewsouth.org\/calendar\/detail\/?ProgramId=401&amp;OccurrenceId=498\">Click for details<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Galaxy Cinema, Cary<\/strong><br \/>\nWednesday, October 27<br \/>\n7 p.m.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/events\/welcome-to-shelbyville-film-screening\/\">Click for details and to RSVP<\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>Welcome to Shelbyville is produced and directed by Kim A.

We had so many great conversations about ways to make North Carolina a more welcoming place for immigrants. We also had great fun watching people fill up our world map with pins. We asked people to mark where they or their families had immigrated from, and hundreds of people marked their spot on the map. The finished product shows that we truly are a nation, and a state, of immigrants.<\/p>\n<p>We also unveiled a new Uniting NC T-shirt at the festival. It is modeled in the photo above by Uniting NC board member Dan Rearick. You can order your own, in a variety of colors and styles. If you&#8217;re interested, please contact Dan at dan@unitingnc.org by Friday. He&#8217;ll send you all the information you need to get your shirt.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, in addition to the International Festival, we had another great event this past weekend. Uniting NC arranged for two members of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nc-dreamteam.org\/\">North Carolina Dream Team<\/a> to speak at Raleigh&#8217;s Beth Meyer Synagogue. The two speakers told their stories of being brought, unwillingly, to the United States as children. They are now young adults who feel like Americans, but who have no legal status here. They are struggling to put themselves through college at out-of-state rates, without loans or financial aid, and their future prospects are severely limited. Their heart-felt speeches were truly moving, and we would love for more people to hear their stories. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/contact-us\/\">Let us know<\/a> if we can help bring these brave young people to speak at your gathering.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sorry for the silence on this blog, but Uniting NC has been extremely busy.
