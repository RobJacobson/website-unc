SUMMARY:March 28: Employment Equity in North Carolina: A Community Conversation (Rocky Mount)
DESCRIPTION:Employment equity—where anyone who wants to work\, regardless of race or gender is able to find a quality job—is crucial to ensuring that North Carolina can compete in today’s economy and the economy of the future. \nRural Forward NC and the Budget & Tax Center will share findings from a 2018 report on the status of full employment in North Carolina\, facilitate intentional dialogue about policy change opportunities and learn about your community-driven solutions and innovations. \nCome join community partners as we have a thoughtful and inclusive conversation about what full employment means for the Twin Counties\, eastern North Carolina and the entire state! \nThis event is free. A light meal will be served.
