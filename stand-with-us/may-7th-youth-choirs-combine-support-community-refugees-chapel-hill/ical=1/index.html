SUMMARY:May 7th: Youth Choirs Combine to Support Community Refugees (Chapel Hill)
DESCRIPTION:The Youth Choirs of six Chapel Hill churches will combine to create a massed choir of over 100 young voices to present a concert entitled “Draw the Circle Wide.” The concert will be held on May 7 at 7 p.m. at United Church of Chapel Hill. \nYouth representatives from the participating choirs decided that through their music they would offer support to refugees in their community. They selected the Refugee Support Center\, a volunteer-based organization in Carrboro that provides assistance and resources\, as the recipient of the offering that will be received at the concert. They chose as the theme song\, “Draw the Circle Wide” by Mark A. Miller\, because it expresses the idea of drawing the circle of inclusion wide enough to encompass everyone in our community\, regardless of their background. \nYouth Choirs from Binkley Baptist (Daniel Cherrix\, Director)\, Christ United Methodist (Daniel Steinert\, Director)\, Holy Trinity Lutheran (Laura Alexander\, Cantor)\, University Presbyterian (Tim Baker\, Director)\, University United Methodist (Beth Auman Visser\, Director)\, and United Church of Chapel Hill (Jennifer Anderson\, Director) will perform together and separately. As special guests\, the Karen Choir (Paw Yeh\, Coordinator)\, a choir made up of refugees from Burma\, will also perform. A wide range of music styles will be represented\, including traditional Karen and African\, Gospel\, contemporary and classical. \nThe public is welcome to this concert\, and admission is free.
