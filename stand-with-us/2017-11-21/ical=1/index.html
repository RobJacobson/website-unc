SUMMARY:November 21: Senator Tillis: Pass a Clean Dream Act Now (Raleigh)
DESCRIPTION:Senator Tillis has sponsored the Succeed Act but it is punitive in many ways\, and there is broad public support to pass the Dream Act. This is what the Dreamers want in order to continue to their lives. Their action at the Senate office building was incredibly moving last week. Several local organizations are joining together to support the beautiful young people who are our future. This is a multigenerational event.
