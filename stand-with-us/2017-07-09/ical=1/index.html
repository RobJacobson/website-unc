SUMMARY:July 9: Eat for Equality\, Drink for Justice (Durham)
DESCRIPTION:Join Legal Aid of North Carolina at Ponysaurus Brewing on July 9 between 12-4 p.m. to enjoy great food and fellowship in support of low-income and vulnerable North Carolinians. Sympathy for the Deli is very generously donating a barbecue buffet (can’t beat their smoked\, whole hog barbecue) for the occasion! We hope to see you there! \nLegal Aid of North Carolina provides the only hope for justice to millions of low-income and vulnerable North Carolinians facing serious civil legal problems like domestic violence\, homelessness\, predatory lending and more. Despite the greater-than-ever need for Legal Aid\, we stand to lose millions of dollars in funding due to budget cuts in Washington and the General Assembly. Now more than ever\, your support will help ensure that we can continue to fulfill the promise of equal justice for all North Carolinians. Learn more at www.legalaidnc.org.
