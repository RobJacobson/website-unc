SUMMARY:August 23: Monsters to Destroy (Greensboro)
DESCRIPTION:Monsters to Destroy (M2D) is a humorous LIVE multimedia talk by filmmaker and comedian Ben Tumin examining refugee resettlement in the U.S. Weaving together information about the Syrian refugee crisis\, personal narrative\, and pre-recorded interviews\, Ben argues for expanded refugee resettlement on national security grounds. \nThrough a series of humanizing—and often humorous—interviews\, he introduces the audience to five young Syrian refugees living in Germany\, as well as a retired marine working in human rights advocacy. Their struggles\, hopes\, and passionate advocacy come into even sharper focus as Ben recounts the story of his grandfather\, a German-Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis just prior to World War II. \nScott Cooper\, Director of National Security Outreach at Human Rights First\, describes the talk as\, “An unexpectedly brilliant cross between John Oliver and a Ted Talk… fun\, sobering\, and informative.” \nThis will be Ben’s 15th stop on a nationwide tour and his first in North Carolina. \nThis performance of M2D is presented in partnership with Every Campus A Refuge\, Guilford College\, The Guilford College Center for Principled Problem Solving\, ELON LAW SCHOOL\, Church World Service\, and the UNCG Center for New North Carolinians. \nTickets are free but donations to Every Campus a Refuge are encouraged and highly appreciated to support current and future guests. Donations can be made at the following link (select Every Campus A Refuge as the area of support): https://bit.ly/2OF5RJx \nFor further information\, you can contact Professor Diya Abdo at abdod@guilford.edu. See you on the 23rd!
