SUMMARY:June 25: Day of Action- #StandWithMuslims in Raleigh (on-call)
DESCRIPTION:Update: The Supreme Court decision on #MuslimBan is expected in the coming days. We will gather at Terry Sanford Federal Building at 6pm on the day of the decision to challenge this racist policy\, irrespective of Supreme Court’s decision. \nIn mid-late June\, the Supreme Court will issue its decision in Trump v. Hawai’i—deciding the fate of Trump’s Muslim Ban. \nNo matter what the Supreme Court decides\, it’s crucial that we have a visible\, strong presence across the country of people who care about Muslim and refugee communities and oppose Trump’s White Nationalist agenda. The #NoMuslimBanEver campaign is calling for a national day of action whenever the decision is announced. \nThis is an ON-CALL protest as we await the decision expected in mid-to-late June. Invite your friends and stay tuned to this page for more details! \nSponsored by\nMuslims for Social Justice\nMovement to End Racism and Islamophobia\nProject South\nMPower Change
