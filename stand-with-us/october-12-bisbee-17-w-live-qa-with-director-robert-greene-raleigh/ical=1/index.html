SUMMARY:October 12: Bisbee 17' w/ Live Q&A with Director Robert Greene (Raleigh)
DESCRIPTION:An old mining town on the Arizona-Mexico border finally reckons with its darkest day: the deportation of 1200 immigrant miners exactly 100 years ago. Locals collaborate to stage recreations of their controversial past. \nOpening night – featuring a live Q&A w/ Director Robert Greene (NCSU ’00) moderated by Ana Pardo\, Policy Advocate for the NC Justice Center’s Workers’ Rights Project. \n“Even though “Bisbee ’17” depicts a wholesome and harmonious community undertaking\, it is a profoundly haunted and haunting film.” – A.O. Scott\, New York Times – Critic’s Pick \n“The result is a singularly American riff on The Act of Killing\, a fascinating and dream-like mosaic that’s less driven by residual anger than by cockeyed concern\, less interested in exhuming the past than in revealing its value to the present.” – David Ehrlich\, IndieWire \n“Remembering the past is not enough to prevent its recurrence. It has to be kept alive.” – Sam Adams\, Slate
