SUMMARY:February 21: Love Resists- Immigration Action #DREAMActNow (Hillsborough)
DESCRIPTION:Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) has taken center stage as the lives of hundreds of thousands of immigrants hang in the balance of political infighting. But there are close to 11 million immigrants living int he shadows of our country. \nWhat can be done to bring them out of the shadows? If we truly want to resist the xenophobia exhibited by our current policies and laws\, where do we start? \nHow can we create the kinds of schools\, communities\, towns\, cities\, states\, and ultimately country that is welcoming and supportive of diversity and humanity. \nNorth Carolina led the way with equal rights by having a sit-in at a Woolworth Counter in Greensboro to protest the racism of Jim Crow. NC can lead the way again. Forward together.
