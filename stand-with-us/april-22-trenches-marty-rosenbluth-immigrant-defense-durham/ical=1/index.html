SUMMARY:April 22: In the Trenches: Marty Rosenbluth on Immigrant Defense (Durham)
DESCRIPTION:Immigration attorney Marty Rosenbluth worked the summer of 2016 in Greece–supporting Syrian refugees fleeing violence and searching for a safe haven. He also volunteered for refugees from Latin America and elsewhere at the Dilley Detention Center on the Texas/Mexico border. He now continues his work in Lumpkin\, Georgia–defending undocumented Americans facing deportation. He will discuss his work on the front lines of justice work for immigrants and refugees\, sharing stories and reflections about the current political climate. \nRabbi Larry Bach and members of the Refugee Resettlement and Immigrant Justice Committee will connect this work to Jewish tradition and discuss concrete ways our congregation can support refugees and immigrants here in Durham and Chapel Hill. \nLunch from Mediterranean Deli will be provided. In lieu of a fee\, we suggest directing your donation to Church World Service\, HIAS\, Alerta Migratoria\, or the CARA ProBono Project. \nThis event coincides with the opening of an art exhibit in the Rosenzweig Gallery by and about Immigrant Justice in the US. \nCo-sponsored by the JRC Adult Education Committee and the Refugee Resettlement and Immigrant Justice Subcommittee of Social Action.
