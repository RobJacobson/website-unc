SUMMARY:June 16: Community Forum/ Foro Communitario on ICE (Durham)
DESCRIPTION:The Durham Human Relations Commission will host a community forum as a community response to the current climate in our community due actions by ICE. The forum is a continuation of our July 2017 statement: “separating individuals from their families and local communities would go against our humanitarian principles. We\, the City of Durham Human Relations Commission\, value every member of the community and urge that immigrants seeking sanctuary be protected.” \nThe forum will focus on solutions that Durham can take at the local level like limiting the use of ICE detainers\, not participating in 287g/Secure Communities\, and support community-driven responses to safety like sanctuary\, legal defense funds\, power of attorney clinics\, and perhaps other policies that can keep people safe while at school\, at the hospital\, seeking help from domestic violence\, or other places. \nThe forum will be on June 16 from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Edison Johnson Community Center. At the Forum\, people will have the chance to: \n1. hear from organizations in our community already deeply involved in these efforts\n2. engage in small group conversations to ask questions and provide ideas\n3. connect with organizations and others. \nThe Durham Human Relations Commission recognizes that the date of this event also marks the one year anniversary in which Pastor Jose Chicas has been in sanctuary in our community. \nPlease\njoin us on June 16 from 1 to 4 p.m. at Edison Johnson Recreation\nCenter\, 500 W. Murray\, Durham\, NC\, 27704.
