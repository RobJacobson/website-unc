SUMMARY:February 23: Earned Income Tax Credit Awareness Day (Charlotte)
DESCRIPTION:Charlotte Center for Legal Advocacy will be at Goodwill Industries of the Southern Piedmont on February 23\, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. to help taxpayers understand the benefits of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). \nEITC is a benefit for working people with low to moderate income. The credit reduces the amount of taxes qualifying taxpayers may have to pay and could result in a refund. \nEligible families with three or more qualifying children could get a maximum credit up to $6\,431. EITC for people without children could mean up to $519 added to their tax refund. \nFind out if the EITC could benefit you and your family!
