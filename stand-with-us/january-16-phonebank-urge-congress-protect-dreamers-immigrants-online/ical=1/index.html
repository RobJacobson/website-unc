SUMMARY:January 16-19: Phonebank- Urge Congress to Protect DREAMers & Immigrants (online)
DESCRIPTION:Join us today\, tomorrow or Thursday as we conduct a phone bank\, helping North Carolinians to contact their legislators and demand a legislative fix. You can make calls from home or join us in person in Raleigh Thursday evening\, 5:30 to 8:30pm (weather permitting). \nSignup here for instructions and more details: https://bit.ly/Phonebank2018 \nOver the past week\, we saw a small victory for DACA recipients as a federal court ordered USCIS to accept DACA renewal applications while DACA litigation is pending. Though a step in the right direction and a signal that even the courts believe it is right to protect undocumented youth\, Dreamers deserve more. They deserve a bipartisan clean Dream Act and they deserve it now. \nCongress has until January 19th to pass the Dream Act. Despite rumors of progress in bipartisan negotiations\, we have not yet seen a draft of the proposed legislation or a vote. North Carolinian Representatives and Senators need to hear from you\, their constituents\, before the 19th. Help us tell them why providing protection and stability to the over 800\,000 youth at risk of losing status is important to you and to North Carolina. \nCan’t make calls to supporters? Then sign our action alert here:bit.ly/2AV2xC5and then share the link on Facebook and Twitter using the hashtags #DreamActNow and #HeretoStayNC.
