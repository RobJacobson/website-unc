SUMMARY:August 5: FaithAction Downtown Unity Walk for Immigration Reform
DESCRIPTION:We are living through one of the harshest and concerning times around immigration policy in modern history. Thousands of our newest immigrant and refugee neighbors are at risk\, and we will not turn our backs on them. We have come to understand the unique challenges and appreciate the gifts of our newest neighbors\, and we are united in our commitment to serve\, love\, and protect them. We will put our faith into action by speaking out for: \nThe end of bigotry and hate\, and a welcoming embrace and policies for immigrants and refugees from around the world \nImmigration reform that ends devastating detention and deportation policies\, and keeps immigrant and refugee families together \nThe protection and expansion of the DACA program\, offering hope and security to thousands of immigrant youth \nA pathway to legal status that includes in-state tuition\, driverâ€™s licenses\, work permits and a living wage for all \nWe recognize the outstanding work being done in our region by immigrant and refugee leaders\, faith communities\, schools\, health and social service agencies\, law enforcement\, businesses\, city government\, and many others to build bridges of greater understanding\, trust and cooperation towards a better community for all. We hope our elected officials at the local\, state and national level recognize and share these values\, listen to and respect our united voice\, and legislate in a way that ensures dignity\, justice\, and equal opportunity for all of our beloved neighbors and friends.
