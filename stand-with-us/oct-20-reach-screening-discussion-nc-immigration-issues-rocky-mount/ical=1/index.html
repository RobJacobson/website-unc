SUMMARY:Oct 20: Out of Reach-Screening & Discussion of NC Immigration Issues (Rocky Mount)
DESCRIPTION:We will screen a film from the America Divided series\, “Out of Reach\,” to be followed by a conversation about immigration issues in North Carolina. Popcorn and drinks will be provided. \nThe event will be held in the Brown Auditorium Conference Center at Nash Community College. Please register at https://bit.ly/CampusConvoBTC. \nFrom the America Divided site: \n“As the fate of some 11 million undocumented immigrants has become the political football of the 2016 campaign\, actress America Ferrera heads to Texas\, the state with the longest border and home to 1.65 million people living without papers. Ferrera\, whose parents and siblings are immigrants from Honduras\, understands the challenges faced by the new arrivals to the U.S. fleeing in Central America. In “Out of Reach\,” she witnesses the special difficulties for Central American refugees in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas\, where US Border Patrol checkpoints inside the US\, many miles from the border\, keep undocumented people hemmed-in and place the American dream out of reach.”
