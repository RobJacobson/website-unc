SUMMARY:July 8: Forbidden: Undocumented & Queer in Rural America (Winston-Salem)
DESCRIPTION:To follow up the rally on June 30th and keep the conversation and work going\, we are excited to announce the screening of “Forbidden: Undocumented and Queer in Rural America” in partnership with a/perture cinema on July 8th! \nFurthermore\, in conjunction with the film\, we are extremely lucky to also be able to host a discussion with local activist\, and the protagonist of the film\, Moises Serrano. \nThe goal will be to provide further space for learning\, engaging\, and organizing around the urgent issues of immigration rights\, LGBTQ rights\, and much more. Donations will be collected outside to support and aid current immigrant justice organizations and efforts. \nThanks to a/perture cinema\, Moises\, and many others for collaborating on this effort and providing a space to keep the momentum and engagement rolling following the rally! \nMore on the film: \nGrowing up in rural North Carolina\, Moises Serrano fell in love with a country that refused to recognize his full humanity – both as an undocumented immigrant and as a gay man. The documentary Forbidden follows Moises’ personal journey as an activist fighting for the American Dream. \nForbidden illustrates the intersection of queer and immigrant issues and addresses the realities facing LGBTQ minorities who have grown up in the rural south surrounded by white faces and homophobic attitudes. The threat is real — the KKK still holds weekly meetings not far from Moises’ hometown of Yadkinville\, and he has found dead rats in his mailbox and white crosses on his front porch. Not everyone in the United States is treated equally or given a fair chance. Moises’ story demonstrates courage\, conviction and an unyielding desire to succeed. Our goal with Forbidden is to motivate viewers to take action and inspire young people to speak out so that a story like Moises’ is not simply seen as remarkable\, but is seen as normal.
