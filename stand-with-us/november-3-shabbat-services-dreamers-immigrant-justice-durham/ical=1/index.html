SUMMARY:November 3: Shabbat Services for Dreamers & Immigrant Justice (Durham)
DESCRIPTION:Judea Reform is joining forces with the Union for Reform Judaism’s Religious Action Coalition to support the Dream Sabbath initiative. Through the Interfaith Immigration Coalition\, the Shabbat for Immigrant Justice initiative is enlisting churches\, synagogues and mosques across the U.S. to dedicate time during or around their regular weekly worship service to a conversation about the Dream Act and Immigrant Justice. As part of this partnership of faith-based organizations\, Judea Reform is committed to supporting reforms to immigration policy that are fair and humane and reflect our mandate to welcome the stranger and treat all human beings with dignity and respect. \nCome join Judea Reform Congregation for a Shabbat Service for Immigrant Justice on Friday\, November 3 at 7:30pm. \nCome by our Selfie Photo Booth at the Oneg — we will be taking photos to share on social media to amplify the #Faith4Dream message. And see below for other ways to stand in solidarity with DREAMers\, including the most urgent call to call your congress members on Nov. 6 and urge them to support a clean Dream Act. \nRead more about the Religious Action Coalition’s call to action here:https://rac.org/protect-stranger-love-thy-neighbor-pass-dream-act-0 \n——————— \nWe need a Clean Dream Act of 2017 \nThe Dream Act has the power to protect over 1.5 million undocumented members of our community who arrived in the United States as children. This is the only home they have ever known. As their friends\, allies\, and faith leaders\, it is our responsibility to do what we can to lift their voices and advocate for their safety. This is even more imperative now that President Trump has rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that kept almost 800\,000 immigrant youth protected from deportation. Congress has less than six months to act and ensure these individuals are not betrayed by the U.S. government and deported. It is critical that Congress pass a “clean” Dream Act 2017\, without enforcement provisions or other negative proposals.
