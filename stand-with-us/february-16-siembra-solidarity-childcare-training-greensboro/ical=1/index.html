SUMMARY:February 16: Siembra Solidarity Childcare Training (Greensboro)
DESCRIPTION:Join us to get trained as a childcare volunteer to support Siembra NC’s awesome work for Latinx undocumented immigrants. Childcare volunteers hang out with Siembra member-leaders’ kids during meetings\, canvassing and events as needed to free up parents to offer their full brilliance and leadership to this crucial work. We provide fun and educational activities for kids while their bad-ass parents are working on building a better community for all of us. Many of us volunteers bring our own kids and enjoy the play time with them and new friends and neighbors. \nRegistration form
