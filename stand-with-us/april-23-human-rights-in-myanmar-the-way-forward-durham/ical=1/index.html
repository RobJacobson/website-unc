SUMMARY:April 23: Human Rights in Myanmar: The Way Forward (Durham)
DESCRIPTION:The Myanmar military’s campaign against the Rohingya population is set in a tenuous backdrop of ethnic armed conflict\, a stagnant national peace and reconciliation process\, and a fledgling democracy led by a now-controversial Nobel Peace Prize laureate. In a special to Duke undergraduates\, Yee Htun\, a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School with over a decade of experience in international advocacy and a refugee from Myanmar herself\, will unpack the multidimensional human rights situation in Myanmar and discuss opportunities forward for both domestic and international actors. \nSPEAKER BIO \nYee has over a decade of international advocacy experience working on behalf of refugee and migrant communities. Most recently\, she was a clinical fellow with Harvard Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic and the Director of the Myanmar Program for Justice Trust\, a human rights research and advocacy organization that works closely with local lawyers and activists in Myanmar to support communities fighting for justice. In 2011\, Yee was selected by the Nobel Women’s Initiative to coordinate and lead the first-ever international campaign to stop rape and sexual violence in conflict. She has authored numerous advocacy reports on Myanmar\, which have been submitted to the U.N. and its Special Rapporteurs. \nYee was born in Myanmar and left the country after the pro-democratic uprising in 1988\, immigrating to Canada as a government sponsored refugee. She holds a B.A. from Simon Fraser University and J.D. from Dalhousie University.
