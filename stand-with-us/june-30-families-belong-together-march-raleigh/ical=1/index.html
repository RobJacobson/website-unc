SUMMARY:June 30: Families Belong Together March (Raleigh)
DESCRIPTION:Donald Trump and his administration are cruelly separating children from their families. But we won’t allow it to continue. On June 30\, we’re rallying in Washington\, D.C.\, and around the country to tell Donald Trump and his administration to stop separating kids from their parents! \nJoin us on June 30 to send a clear message to Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress: Families Belong Together! \nJoin concerned North Carolinians as we march against the trump administration’s cruel and unusual punishment of families fleeing their homes for better lives. We’ll show the country and the world that North Carolina stands on the side of decency and humanity\, not the callous tearing apart of families. Join us! \nDirections: March starts at City Plaza\, downtown Raleigh\, located at 400 Fayetteville St. Raleigh 27601 and will end at Halifax Mall\, 16 W. Jones St. \nPLEASE RSVP HERE TOO:\nhttps://act.moveon.org/event/families-belong-together_attend1/19949
