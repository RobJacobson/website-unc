SUMMARY:April 16: Selena Movie Party (Raleigh)
DESCRIPTION:COME PAY TRIBUTE TO THE LEGEND WITH US.\nShe was the “Queen of Tejano Music.” Tom Brokaw called her the “Madonna of Mexico.” But to so many of us\, she was simply called Selena. \nSelena Quintanilla-Perez was an American singer\, songwriter\, spokesperson\, actress\, and fashion designer whose contributions to the music and the fashion industry made her one of the most celebrated Mexican American entertainers of the late 20th Century. Tragically\, Selena was taken from this world far too soon. \nJoin us for a special screening of the 1997 film SELENA\, starring Jennifer Lopez and Edward James Olmos. At this Movie Party celebration\, we’ll provide themed props to use during the film\, including a handy lyric sheet to make it easier to sing along (even if you already know the songs by heart). Also\, don’t forget to arrive early for a custom pre-show completely dedicated to Selena with her music videos and rare\, hard-to-find interviews.
