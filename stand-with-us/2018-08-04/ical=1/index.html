SUMMARY:August 4: Museum + A Meal: The Legacy of NC's 1st Muslims (Durham)
DESCRIPTION:Museum + A Meal: Exploring the Legacy of North Carolina’s 1st Muslims \nJoin us as we visit the Museum of Durham History’s exhibit on the first Muslims to start a mosque community in North Carolina. Afterward\, we will have a (vegetarian) community lunch at a locally owned Kenyan restaurant with many of the founding members of this community and curators of the exhibit. We invite you to engage with this piece of local history as we explore what it means to Muslim Americans. \nTicket sales include the cost of lunch and a donation to the Movement to End Racism and Islamophobia (MERI)\, a grassroots organization that works to confront\, resist\, and transform Islamophobia and racism through fighting the social\, systemic\, and ideological dynamics of hatred that are currently threaded through our communities. \nWe ask that you purchase your tickets via Eventbrite. Tickets cannot be purchased nor returned after July 28th\, no exceptions. \n— \nMore information on the exhibit:\nAr-Razzaq Islamic Center (formerly Muhammad’s Mosque #34) was founded in Durham in the 1950s under the local leadership of Imam Kenneth Muhammad\, and has been an anchor of the West End neighborhood since the 1970s. Members of Ar-Razzaq established or strengthened other Muslim communities across the state\, including those in Raleigh\, Fayetteville\, Wilmington\, and the Kinston/Greenville area.
