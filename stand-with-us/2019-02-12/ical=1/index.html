SUMMARY:February 12: Wilmington Roadshow Lunch (Wilmington)
DESCRIPTION:Join the Council for lunch to learn a bit of our history and current initiatives along with strategies and visions for going forward. We are made of 18 denominations across the state and work in multiple arenas ranging from Immigration to the Environment\, from Living Wage advocacy to the Opioid Crisis — matters that affect the daily lives of the people who live in our state. Taking our cues from the Old Testament Prophets and the New Testament Good News\, we address the issues that God has chosen for us. We will start at 11:55AM\, so come early to sign in\, and we will finish promptly at 1:00PM for those who have a busy afternoon. \nLunch is free\, so bring a friend\, bring two\, bring as many as you like\, just be sure to have everyone sign up. \nRSVP link: https://www.evite.com/event/0029E4ANENCZYMRH2EPI64VOJG4I5M/rsvp?utm_source=NA&utm_medium=sharable_invite&utm_campaign=send_sharable_link
