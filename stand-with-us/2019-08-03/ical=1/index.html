SUMMARY:August 3: Faith Action ID (High Point)
DESCRIPTION:Do You Need A Valid Photo ID?\nThe FaithAction ID is for ANY resident who may have limited access to government issued forms of identification\, and for those who support the mission of FaithAction – turning strangers into neighbors. It is not a government issued form of ID or a driver’s license\, but it is a verifiable form of identification that says you are a part of our community. It can be used by law enforcement to better identify\, serve\, and protect you\, and may be accepted by health centers\, schools\, businesses\, and other city agencies – depending on the policy of each institution.\nSaturday\, August 3rd\, 2019 \nDoors open at 9am\, and participants must attend a mandatory orientation at either 10:00am or 1:00pm. Please arrive early! \nYWCA High Point – 155 W. Westwood Ave.\, High Point\, NC 27262
