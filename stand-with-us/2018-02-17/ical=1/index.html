SUMMARY:February 17: Challenging the Muslim and Immigrant Ban (Raleigh)
DESCRIPTION:Carolina Peace Center welcomes you to a Panel on Muslim Travel Ban and anti-immigrant policies including DACA recipients. Community faith leaders\, legal counsels and political leaders will be among the panelists. The discussion will be centered on draconian policy that is steeped in Islamophobia\, racism and xenophobia. Further\, it will also include dialogue about the anti-immigration policy that has resulted in the deportation of people who have lived in this country for decades. Thus\, sending hard-working immigrants back to their countries where they face a very precarious future. \nWe will also discuss viable solutions to these inhumane policies in the hopes of moving forward and offering a helping hand to those who are suffering as a direct result of current hate-fueled policies. An after citizenship workshop is also being planned after the event.\nList of panelists will be updated on this event page in coming days. \nThe event will be held on February 17th\, 2018 from 3:00 – 5:00 PM in Finlator Hall at Pullen Memorial Baptist Church. Please join us for a discussion on current climate of bigotry and hatred related to anti-immigration policies and Muslim travel ban in America today.
