SUMMARY:March 30: Naturalization Workshop (Raleigh)
DESCRIPTION:NCAAT is working to increase the number of LPRs applying for citizenship by hosting workshops to provide application assistance. \nOur staff and volunteers will help verify applicantsâ€™ eligibility for citizenship\, complete and file their citizenship applications (form N-400) and prepare their fee waiver requests if they cannot afford the filing fee. These workshops are offered at no cost for attendees whose registration is confirmed in advance. \nOur next workshop will be held in Raleigh on Saturday\, March 30\, 2019\, co-sponsored by NALEO Educational Fund
