SUMMARY:February  14: Show Love for Immigrant Communities this Valentine's Day (Durham)
DESCRIPTION:Last week\, residents across North Carolina and in Durham have had to endure their family\, friends\, neighbors and community members being torn from them by violent ICE operations. In targeted raids across the Triangle and Triad areas\, more than 200 of our neighbors were arrested. Our immigrant community is now living in fear; however\, our community is one that supports diversity and inclusions. We value our immigrant and refugee community and their contributions to the Durham community\, our city in which they live and work along with the rest of us. \nValentine’s Day is usually a day reserved for our loved ones. It’s that one time of the year where we show how much we love someone with a special present or action. This Valentine’s Day\, it is more important than ever to stand against hateful rhetoric\, practices\, and policies that tear our families and communities apart. We must stand in solidarity with our immigrant communities and show them that we will not let ICE tear apart our communities. We invite you to engage in putting forth visions and policy demands for cities\, schools\, and communities that support all our members and build on the gifts that immigrants and refugees bring to our communities. \nPlease come out to the Lakewood Cocoa Cinnamon location this Valentine’s to show your support for our immigrant community. We will have card making supplies (no art skills required) so that you can make a love letter for refugees\, immigrants living in Sanctuary in our community\, or to thank our sheriff for choosing not to cooperate with ICE. You can also write letters to our Representatives and Governor asking them to condemn these raids and pressure ICE to leave North Carolina. Churros and candy will be provided to card makers! We will also have information about Know Your Rights and other ways to work with local organizations to support those affected by the raids. Community groups and CWS staff will be on hand to grab a cup of coffee with and ask any questions that you may have about immigrants and refugees.
