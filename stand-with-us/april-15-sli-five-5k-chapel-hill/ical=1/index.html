SUMMARY:April 15: Sli-Five 5K (Chapel Hill)
DESCRIPTION:N.C Sli is hosting their first Sli-Five 5K! The 5K’s theme is geared towards action (think a high-five with a twist; Sli-Five) as our students prepare to chase their dreams. N.C. Sli seeks to create pathways to educational\, professional\, and civic engagement opportunities for a new generation of Latinx leaders in North Carolina. \nWe aspire to create stronger\, more equitable communities in North Carolina by building a support network that identifies our students’ strengths\, affirms their identities\, and invests in their leadership. This 5K will aid our senior scholars who participated in our three-year mentoring program\, to pursue their post-secondary dreams.
