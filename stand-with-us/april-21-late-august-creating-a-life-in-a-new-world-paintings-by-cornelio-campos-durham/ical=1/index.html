SUMMARY:April 21-Late August: Creating a Life in A New World Paintings by Cornelio Campos (Durham)
DESCRIPTION:April 20-late August 2018: Cornelio Campos is a self-taught Mexican-American artist based in Durham\, N.C. Mr. Campos immigrated to the United States from Mexico as a teenager—a journey and process that now influence many of his paintings. Vibrant colors\, iconic American symbols\, and intricate geometric patterns define Mr. Campos’s work. Through his paintings\, he illustrates some of the harsh realities of immigrating to America that immigrants often overlook. Moreover\, Mr. Campos’s paintings exemplify techniques that he has learned through observation\, and often defy traditional color schemes. His paintings contain therapeutic\, controversial\, and enlightening elements that make them both unique and unforgettable.
