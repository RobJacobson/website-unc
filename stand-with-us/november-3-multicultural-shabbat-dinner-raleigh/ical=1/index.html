SUMMARY:November 3: A Multicultural Shabbat Dinner (Raleigh)
DESCRIPTION:The Social Action Committee is excited to invite the Beth Meyer Community to a multicultural Shabbat experience. The committee’s mission is to pursue righteousness through action to make the world a better place for all of its inhabitants. We live in a vibrant\, multicultural country and sharing differences can help deepen our level of understanding within our diverse community. The dinner’s theme “We Are All Immigrants” sets the stage for members of our congregation to share a dish from their family’s cultural or ethnic heritage. \nThere is no registration fee for this event\, and all are welcome to participate. Some of the ways you can contribute include preparing a dish\, helping with set up and clean up\, and making a donation. Social Action Committee will reimburse all out of pocket expenses. \nSpace will be limited for this event. Confirm your RSVP and let us know what you’ll be preparing by visiting https://www.signupgenius.com/go/60b0f49aca729aa8-weare (same URL as the “tickets” link) \nQuestions?
