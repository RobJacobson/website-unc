SUMMARY:March 4th: Communities Against Islamophobia (Raleigh)
DESCRIPTION:Muslim Women For is proud to partner with the American Friends Service Committee of the Carolinas\, a Quaker organization that has an extensive history of promoting lasting peace with justice\, as a practical expression of faith in action. It is the mission of ‘Muslim Women For’ to provide resources and tangible strategies to promote leadership. \nThis training is designed for a Muslim-only audience to unpack Islamophobia in-depth and strategize around meaningful ways for our communities to resist anti-Muslimism right now. Networking and base-building opportunities will be made available at the end of the program. This training is especially important for young activists\, Muslim leaders\, people of color and women. \nThere are a very limited number of seats and only registered participants may attend. \nWe would love to accommodate different learning styles and differently abled folks. Please let us know on the registration form how we can ensure you are comfortable in the space. \nDATE:\nMARCH 4TH 1:30-3:30PM \nLOCATION: Raleigh\, NC. The exact location will be provided after successful registration. \nREGISTER: https://goo.gl/forms/b0FoRvVuscnfy3pe2
