SUMMARY:December 15: Buses\, Borders\, and Butler High School: Unpacking Systemic Violence (Charlotte)
DESCRIPTION:Across the globe\, marginalized communities are rising up in the face of injustice and dehumanization!\nHow do we keep ourselves and our broader community safe when we are constantly facing violence\, displacement\, and oppression? \nHere in Charlotte\, a student was shot in the halls of Butler High School and another student is now facing a potential lifetime behind bars.\nIn the last two weeks\, over 300 asylum-seeking families have come through our city after being detained in immigration detention centers.\nIn Durham\, a man named Samuel Bruno was just deported after a long and painful battle with ICE.\nThe Charlotte Mecklenburg School system has just announced their plan to further militarize our childrenâ€™s campuses without the input of our students or community members.\nWe have a duty to show up for one another\, Charlotte! \nAt this gathering\, we will be processing these recent local events\, learning how they connect\, and dreaming and collaborating on how we can move forward.\nWe must act and we must begin to heal if we wish to see change in our community.\nIt takes ALL of us!. \nJoin Charlotte Uprising\, the Southeast Asian Coalition\, and Comunidad Colectiva as we process through and unpack the impact of systemic violence on our people and come up with ways to protect and take care of one another. \nWE KEEP US SAFE!
