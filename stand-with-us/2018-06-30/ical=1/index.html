SUMMARY:June 25: Day of Action- #StandWithMuslims in Raleigh (on-call)
DESCRIPTION:Update: The Supreme Court decision on #MuslimBan is expected in the coming days. We will gather at Terry Sanford Federal Building at 6pm on the day of the decision to challenge this racist policy\, irrespective of Supreme Court’s decision. \nIn mid-late June\, the Supreme Court will issue its decision in Trump v. Hawai’i—deciding the fate of Trump’s Muslim Ban. \nNo matter what the Supreme Court decides\, it’s crucial that we have a visible\, strong presence across the country of people who care about Muslim and refugee communities and oppose Trump’s White Nationalist agenda. The #NoMuslimBanEver campaign is calling for a national day of action whenever the decision is announced. \nThis is an ON-CALL protest as we await the decision expected in mid-to-late June. Invite your friends and stay tuned to this page for more details! \nSponsored by\nMuslims for Social Justice\nMovement to End Racism and Islamophobia\nProject South\nMPower Change

SUMMARY:June 30: Families Belong Together Rally (Winston-Salem)
DESCRIPTION:Join the Winston-Salem community during the national day of action on June 30th – Families Belong Together. \nDonald Trump\, Border Patrol\, ICE\, and his administration are cruelly separating children from their families and criminalizing both immigrant children and their parents. \nBut we won’t allow it to continue. On June 30\, activists are rallying in Washington\, D.C. and around the country to tell Donald Trump and his administration to stop separating kids from their parents! \nWe stand in support of this movement and will rally in Winston Salem to voice our dissent to these horrific policies and dehumanizing efforts. \nThroughout the country\, folks are already blockading ICE offices and occupying the offices of politicians who are refusing to take action and do what is right. We wholeheartedly believe that no human is illegal and that we must stand up for immigrant rights\, which are human rights. \nTrump and his administration have been systematically criminalizing immigration and immigrants\, from revoking Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) to ramping up intimidating ICE tactics. \nFAMILIES BELONG TOGETHER. \nEnd Family Separation.\nDefund ICE & BCP.\nEnd For-Profit Detention Centers.\nFix the DACA crisis.\nFight for dignity and labor rights for immigrant workers. \nThe planning meeting for the event will be next Tuesday at 7PM at Fearless Winston Salem (1002 Brookstown Avenue\, Winston Salem\, NC 27101). https://www.facebook.com/events/237387596993679/?notif_t=plan_edited&notif_id=1529498161828968
