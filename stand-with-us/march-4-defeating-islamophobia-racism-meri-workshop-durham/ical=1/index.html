SUMMARY:March 4: Defeating Islamophobia & Racism: MERI Workshop (Durham)
DESCRIPTION:Join Judea Reform Congregation’s Social Action Committee at a workshop led by the North Carolina-based network called MERI (Movement to End Racism and Islamophobia). In addition to sharing information\, MERI believes in taking practical actions to defeat Islamophobia and racism. In the workshop\, we will identify practical steps we can take to organize against these oppressions. You will leave with examples of solidarity actions\, information about upcoming events\, and other resources to support long-term actions to defeat Islamophobia and racism. \nRegistration is free and open to anyone in our community\, although we recommend a donation of $18 to Judea Reform Congregation’s Social Action Fund to support social action initiatives like this one. \nLocated in the Levin Social Hall at Judea Reform Congregation. \nFor more info on MERI\, visit https://merinc.org/
