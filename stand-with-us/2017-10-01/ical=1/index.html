SUMMARY:October 1: Defend DACA March (Raleigh)
DESCRIPTION:NOTE: THE MARCH WILL BEGIN AT NASH SQUARE. Halifax Mall is our ending point\, which will have speakers and tablers.\nPlease begin gathering at 11:30AM at Nash Square\, as the march itself will begin at 12:00PM. \nTrump’s most recent actions against the immigrant community are not in line with the vision of diversity\, acceptance\, and opportunity which the USA stands for. \nWe are attempting to organize a large-scale demonstration to #DefendDACAin Raleigh\, NC. This would involve marching from a public square (Nash Square) to the Legislative Office in downtown to deliver letters in support of DACA to our State Representatives. We will then march to Halifax Mall\, where speakers and tablers will be to provide information about further action to take. \nCome out and show your support for #DACA and make your voice heard. \nFor more information and actions you can take\, check out:https://dreamers.fwd.us/
