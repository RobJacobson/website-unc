SUMMARY:July 28: Imprisoned Justice: Inside Georgia Immigration Detention Centers (Raleigh)
DESCRIPTION:Bring your lunch and learn directly from one of the authors of a new report on abuses faced by immigrant detainees in two facilities in Georgia. The vast majority of all detained immigrants and refugees from North Carolina are held in these Georgia centers.
