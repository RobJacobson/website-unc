SUMMARY:November 6-10: Clean Dream Act: Call to Action (High Point)
DESCRIPTION:YWCA USA & YWCA High Point’s Latino Family Center support a CLEAN Dream Act!\nOn November 6th through November 10th we will be having our Call to Action Week in support of a Clean Dream Act.\nThis is the time to urge congress to pass a CLEAN Dream Act and save the livelihood of thousands of immigrant youth who contribute to this coutnry they call home. \nWhy does Congress need to pass a clean Dream Act?\n-DACA is phased out. Thousands of immigrant youth will start to lose their right to work starting March 6th.\n– DACA does not provide a legal status; it provides a 2 year protection from being deported and a 2 year renewable work permit\n– DACA holders needed to renew their work permit every 2 years at a cost of $495 (immigration costs) plus lawyer’s cost\, which can vary\n– Current DACA holders do not qualify for in-state tuition at public UNC institutions or community colleges. They also do not qualify for any type of financial aid or government grants. If a DACA holder or undocumented student wants to pursue higher education he/she will need to pay the out-of-state tuition rate \nThe time to ACT is NOW! \nActions you can take are: \n-CALL YOUR REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS\n-EMAIL YOUR REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS\n-WRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR AT YOUR LOCAL NEWSPAPER\n-JOIN GROUPS IN YOUR AREA CURRENTLY TAKING ACTION
