SUMMARY:July 26: Bridging Gaps: Supporting Latino Immigrant Mental Health Through Case Management Services (Webinar)
DESCRIPTION:Research supports addressing the broad range of social determinants that affect health outcomes. This is especially true of those in the Latinx population who need case management services\, often requiring not only assistance with basic needs but also help contending with unique barriers such as language\, acculturation\, and immigration status. Providing client-centered case management\, collaborating with community partners\, and engaging with the community at-large maximizes the potential for positive mental health outcomes through case management services. \nLearning Objectives: \nTo identify challenges encountered while providing case management services to the Latinx population\, as well as possible solutions.\nTo describe both the importance of forming relationships with employees from other service organizations and the ways in which these relationships benefit individual clients.\nTo identify different ways to promote clients’ self-agency throughout the case management process.\nTo discuss the impact client-centered case management has on mental health outcomes. \n  \nThe link for the webinar is available upon registration.
