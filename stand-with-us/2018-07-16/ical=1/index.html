SUMMARY:July 19:  Rep. David Price Town Hall Meeting Step Up for Immigrants (Raleigh)
DESCRIPTION:We are calling on Rep. Price to take immediate action and advocate on behalf of Juana Tobar\, Rosa Ortez-Cruz\, Samuel Oliver\, Eliseo Jimenez\, Oscar Canales\, and Jose Chicas. \nCongressman Price is hosting a Town Hall meeting in Raleigh on Thursday\, July 19th. This is a perfect opportunity to highlight the inhumane treatment of the #NCSanctuary6 and their families. \nFor these families waiting is no longer an option\, they need action right now. Rep. Price has the power to bring attention to these cases\, and we need to make sure he understands what is at stake. \nIt’s time to bring these stories to his front door. \nWe will tell Congressman Price to do everything in his power for Juana\, Rosa\, Samuel\, Oscar\, Eliseo\, and Jose – to secure their return to their families and homes safe from deportation. \nCombined\, Juana\, Rose\, Samuel\, Oscar\, Eliseo\, and Jose have spent over 50 months in church sanctuary. Over 1\,500 days without intervention or assistance from elected Representatives\, including Congressman David Price. \nJoin us on July 19th. For Juana\, waiting is no longer an option\, she has now been in sanctuary for over a year. Join us at the town hall so we can bring her story\, and that of the other NC Sanctuary 6\, right to Price’s doorstep. Make sure you wear white to support the #NCSanctuary6! \nJoin us! \n-Alerta Migratoria \nhttps://alertamigratorianc.org/
