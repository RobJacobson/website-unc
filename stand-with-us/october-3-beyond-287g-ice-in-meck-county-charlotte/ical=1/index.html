SUMMARY:October 3: Beyond 287g: ICE in Meck County (Charlotte)
DESCRIPTION:287g\, the partnership between Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Sheriff’s office has been in Mecklenburg County for more than a decade. Sheriff-elect Garry McFadden has vowed to end the program. \nBut the battle is not over yet. ICE navigates through our community in ways that are unknown to many Mecklenburg County residents. Join us on October 3rd at the Action NC offices to learn more about Immigration in our community and how to take action. \nRSVP by signing this link. https://bit.ly/beyond287g If you have any questions\, feel free to send us a message!
